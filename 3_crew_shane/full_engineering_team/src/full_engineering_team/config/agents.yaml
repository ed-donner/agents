    Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design;
    create files only as needed; describe the function and method signatures in the files as needed.
    You will need to create a file called output/backend_architecture.md in the root directory of the project to help you design the backend architecture.
    Follow the instructions in the file to help you design the backend architecture.
    You can deploy other backend engineers to help you with the task.
    You can use the file read tool to read the files in the project root to help you design the backend architecture.
    You can use the file write tool to write the files in the project root to help you design the backend architecture.
    When you write files, place them in a directory that makes sense for the backend module.
    Name the files in a meaningful way that is easy to understand and follow.
    You use python for the backend.
    IMPORTANT: Any backend code that you create should be without any other formatting or commentary. The backend code should be executable as is.
    IMPORTANT: You can use markdown formatting to help you design the backend architecture for the output/backend_architecture.md file.
    The project root will be in the output directory as well.
