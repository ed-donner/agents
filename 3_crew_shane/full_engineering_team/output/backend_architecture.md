# Trading Simulation Platform System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for a trading simulation platform. The design focuses on modularity and maintainability, addressing account management, fund transactions, share dealings, portfolio valuations, and transaction history.

## Modules and Components

1. **User Management Module**
    - **UserAccount**: Manages user creation, login, and authentication.
        - `create_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool`: Creates a new user account.
        - `login(username: str, password: str) -> bool`: Authenticates the user.

2. **Financial Module**
    - **AccountBalance**: Manages user balance, deposits, and withdrawals.
        - `deposit(user_id: int, amount: float) -> bool`: Deposits funds into the user's account.
        - `withdraw(user_id: int, amount: float) -> bool`: Withdraws funds ensuring no negative balance.

3. **Trading Module**
    - **ShareTransaction**: Manages buying and selling of shares while ensuring feasible transactions.
        - `buy_shares(user_id: int, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: Records buying shares and updates balance.
        - `sell_shares(user_id: int, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: Records selling shares and updates balance.

4. **Portfolio Management Module**
    - **Portfolio**: Calculates and reports the user's holdings and profit/loss.
        - `calculate_portfolio_value(user_id: int) -> float`: Calculates total portfolio value.
        - `calculate_profit_loss(user_id: int) -> float`: Calculates profit or loss since initial deposit.
        - `report_holdings(user_id: int) -> dict`: Reports current holdings.

5. **Transaction History Module**
    - **TransactionLog**: Keeps a log of all transactions made by the user.
        - `list_transactions(user_id: int) -> list`: Lists all transactions a user has made over time.

## Functionality

- **Account Management**: Users can create accounts and login using the User Management Module.
- **Fund Management**: Users can deposit and withdraw funds through the Financial Module, ensuring no negative balance.
- **Trading Transactions**: Users can buy and sell shares through the Trading Module, ensuring valid transactions.
- **Portfolio Calculation**: Users can view portfolio value and profit/loss using the Portfolio Management Module.
- **Transaction History**: A record of account transactions is maintained via the Transaction History Module.

## Security and Integrity

- **Data Validation**: Each module implements rigorous data validation.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms are employed in the User Management Module.

## Dependencies

- **Price Service**: Relies on the `get_share_price(symbol)` function for current share prices.

## Implementation Notes

- Each module encapsulates responsibilities, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- Clear separation of concerns is maintained across the modules.
- Unit tests are created for each function to ensure functionality and integrity.

*Note: The design may evolve with additional requirements or as insights are gained during implementation. The architecture is open for future enhancements.*
