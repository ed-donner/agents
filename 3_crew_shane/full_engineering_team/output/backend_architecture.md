# Trading Simulation Platform - Backend Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the implemented backend architecture for a trading simulation platform. The architecture prioritizes modularity and maintainability, following clean code principles and separation of concerns.

## Core Modules

### 1. Database Module (`database.py`)
- Provides database connection and transaction management
- Handles table creation and schema management
- Implements query execution and result processing
- Uses SQLite for data storage with potential to switch to PostgreSQL

### 2. User Management Module (`user_management.py`)
- Handles user creation, authentication, and account management
- Implements secure password handling using PBKDF2
- Manages user information and authentication state

### 3. Financial Module (`financial.py`)
- Manages account balances, deposits, and withdrawals
- Ensures transactional integrity for all financial operations
- Provides transaction history for account activities

### 4. Trading Module (`trading.py`)
- Implements share buying and selling logic
- Validates trade operations against available funds and holdings
- Updates user portfolio and account balance during trades

### 5. Portfolio Management Module (`portfolio.py`)
- Calculates portfolio value, profit/loss, and performance metrics
- Generates reports on user holdings and allocation
- Provides portfolio analysis capabilities

### 6. Price Service Module (`price_service.py`)
- Provides stock price information (simulated for this implementation)
- Implements caching and expiration mechanisms
- Manages sample stock data with realistic price movements

### 7. Transaction History Module (`transaction_history.py`)
- Logs all financial transactions and trades
- Provides querying and filtering of transaction history
- Generates transaction statistics and summaries

### 8. Main Application (`app.py`)
- Integrates all modules into a cohesive platform
- Provides a high-level API for all platform operations
- Handles error responses and result formatting

## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following tables:

1. **users** - User account information
   - id (primary key)
   - username (unique)
   - password_hash
   - email (unique)
   - created_at
   - last_login

2. **balances** - User account balances
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key -> users.id)
   - amount
   - last_updated

3. **transactions** - Record of all financial transactions
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key -> users.id)
   - type (deposit, withdrawal)
   - amount
   - description
   - timestamp

4. **holdings** - Current user stock holdings
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key -> users.id)
   - symbol
   - quantity
   - average_price
   - last_updated

5. **trades** - Record of all buy/sell operations
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key -> users.id)
   - symbol
   - operation (buy, sell)
   - quantity
   - price
   - timestamp

6. **prices** - Cached price data for stocks
   - id (primary key)
   - symbol (unique)
   - price
   - timestamp

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented throughout the system with:
- Comprehensive try/except blocks
- Detailed error logging
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Meaningful error messages and status codes

## Security Considerations

- Password hashing using PBKDF2
- Input validation throughout the system
- Transaction isolation to prevent race conditions
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Testing

An integration test suite is provided in `test_integration.py`, covering:
- User registration and authentication
- Account deposits and withdrawals
- Stock buying and selling
- Portfolio management
- Transaction history

## Usage Example

A comprehensive example of using the platform is provided in `example.py`, demonstrating:
- User registration and login
- Depositing funds
- Trading stocks
- Portfolio monitoring
- Transaction history review

## Dependencies

The system primarily uses Python standard libraries with minimal external dependencies, as listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Conclusion

The backend architecture provides a robust, maintainable foundation for a trading simulation platform. It demonstrates proper separation of concerns, transaction integrity, and error handling while remaining flexible for future enhancements.
