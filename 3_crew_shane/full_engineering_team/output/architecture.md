# Trading Simulation Platform System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for a simple account management system designed for a trading simulation platform. The design emphasizes a modular and maintainable architecture, catering to the needs of account creation, login, fund management, share transactions, and calculation of portfolio metrics.

## Modules and Components

1. **User Management Module**
    - **UserAccount**: Handles user creation, login, and authentication.
        - `create_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool`: Creates a new user account.
        - `login(username: str, password: str) -> bool`: Authenticates the user.

2. **Financial Module**
    - **AccountBalance**: Manages user balance, deposits, and withdrawals.
        - `deposit(user_id: int, amount: float) -> bool`: Deposits funds into the user's account.
        - `withdraw(user_id: int, amount: float) -> bool`: Withdraws funds from the user's account, ensuring balance remains non-negative.

3. **Trading Module**
    - **ShareTransaction**: Manages the buying and selling of shares while ensuring feasible transactions.
        - `buy_shares(user_id: int, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: Records buying shares and updates balance.
        - `sell_shares(user_id: int, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`: Records selling shares and updates balance.

4. **Portfolio Management Module**
    - **Portfolio**: Calculates and reports the user's holdings and profit/loss.
        - `calculate_portfolio_value(user_id: int) -> float`: Calculates the total value of the user's portfolio.
        - `calculate_profit_loss(user_id: int) -> float`: Calculates the profit or loss since the initial deposit.
        - `report_holdings(user_id: int) -> dict`: Reports the current holdings of the user.

5. **Transaction History Module**
    - **TransactionLog**: Keeps a log of all transactions made by the user.
        - `list_transactions(user_id: int) -> list`: Lists all transactions a user has made over time.

## Functionality

- **Account Management**: Users can create accounts and login using the User Management Module.
- **Fund Management**: Users can deposit and withdraw funds through the Financial Module, ensuring no negative balance.
- **Trading Transactions**: Users can buy and sell shares through the Trading Module, ensuring valid transactions regarding users' balance and shares available.
- **Portfolio Calculation**: Users can view the value of their portfolio and profit/loss using the Portfolio Management Module.
- **Transaction History**: A record of account transactions is maintained via the Transaction History Module to provide transparency and tracking.

## Security and Integrity

- **Data Validation**: Every module will implement rigorous data validation to ensure consistency and prevent invalid transactions.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms will be employed in the User Management Module to protect user accounts.

## Dependencies

- **Price Service**: The system relies on the `get_share_price(symbol)` function for retrieving current share prices, vital for calculating portfolio values and validating trading transactions.

## Implementation Notes

- Each module will encapsulate responsibilities, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- Clear separation of concerns will be maintained across the modules.
- Unit tests will be created for each function to ensure functionality and integrity.

*Note: The design may evolve with additional requirements or as insights are gained during implementation. The architecture is open for future enhancements, including more complex trading features and integration with external data sources.*
