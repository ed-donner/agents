# Program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series:
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply by 4

# Initialize the sum
series_sum = 0

# Calculate the series
for n in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * n + 1)  # Calculate the term for 1/(2n+1)
    if n % 2 == 0:  # Add if n is even, subtract if n is odd
        series_sum += term
    else:
        series_sum -= term

# Multiply the sum by 4
result = series_sum * 4

# Print the final result
print(result)
The result of the series after 10,000 terms multiplied by 4 is: 3.1414926535900345
Number of iterations: 10000
