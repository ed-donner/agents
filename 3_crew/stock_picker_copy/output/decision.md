**Chosen Company: DraftKings Inc.**
- **Reason for Selection:** DraftKings Inc. holds a dominant 31% market share in the U.S. online gambling landscape, showcasing aggressive growth strategies and a robust user base. The company is set to capitalize on anticipated market expansion, with the total addressable market projected to reach $30 billion by 2028. DraftKings' sustained revenue growth, innovative market strategies, and expectations of profitability make it an attractive investment opportunity.

**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **BetMGM**
   - **Reason for Not Being Selected:** Even though BetMGM has shown strong fiscal performance with a net revenue increase of 36% to $1.96 billion and a 27% share in iGaming markets, it controls only an 11% market share in online sports betting. Its investment potential is contingent upon sustaining its growth trajectory and market positioning amid competitive pressures from larger incumbents like DraftKings and FanDuel.

2. **Flutter Entertainment plc**
   - **Reason for Not Being Selected:** Flutter Entertainment, through its subsidiary FanDuel, leads the U.S. sports betting market with a 43% market share. While it presents lucrative investment potential due to its market leadership and innovation focus, DraftKings' current undervaluation and strategic opportunities for expansive growth provide a more compelling investment case at this time.
