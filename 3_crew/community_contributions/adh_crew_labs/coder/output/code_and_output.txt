```
Python Code for the Calculation:
# Initialize variables
n_terms = 10000
series_sum = 0.0

# Calculate the sum of the first 10,000 terms of the series
for i in range(n_terms):
    term = (-1)**i / (2 * i + 1)  # Alternative term calculation with alternating signs
    series_sum += term

# Multiply the total sum by 4
result = 4 * series_sum

The calculated result for the first 10000 terms of the series, multiplied by 4, is: 3.1414926535900345
