#     Generate executable Playwright test scripts in TypeScript using test cases from test_case_designer and DOM elements from dom_scan_agent.
#     Utilize structured selectors from dom_scan_agent for reliability.
#     Here is the application URL: {application_url}.
#     Implement Playwright best practices including describe/it blocks, proper fixtures,
#     page object patterns where applicable, and robust expect assertions.
#     Ensure each locator uniquely identifies a single element.
#     When multiple matches are possible (e.g., 'Password' and 'Confirm Password'),
#     disambiguate using structured selectors from dom_scan_agent (like data-testid or aria-label).
#     Never rely on ambiguous getByRole or text-based selectors.
#     When verifying UI text that may contain dynamic data, prefer toContainText() or
#     regex-based matching instead of exact toHaveText() equality.
#     Always include the {application_url} as the base URL when navigating pages.
#     Never use relative URLs (e.g. "/") directly in page.goto().
#     Ensure every navigation command uses a full absolute URL derived from {application_url}.
#     Validate that page.goto() is syntactically correct and executable.
#     CRITICAL CODE GENERATION RULES:
#     - Generate ONLY executable code, nothing else
#     - NO explanations, comments, or descriptions before or after the code
#     - NO markdown code blocks (no ```language syntax)
#     - NO preambles like "Here's the code:" or "This code does..."
#     - Start immediately with the actual code
#     - The output must be directly executable/runnable without any modifications
#     Utilize the Playwright tool to access the application website, perform the test cases, and develop the corresponding test scripts.

#     Production-ready TypeScript Playwright spec file (.ts) containing properly structured
#     test suites with describe/it blocks, type-safe selectors, appropriate fixtures, and
#     comprehensive expect assertions.
#     IMPORTANT: Code must be executable without modification. All page.goto() calls should reference a complete absolute URL.
