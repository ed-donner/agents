   5.4. Transactions Screen:  
       - A screen that lists all transactions that the user has made over time.  
       - The data should include date/time, transaction type (buy/sell/deposit/withdrawal), share symbol (if applicable), quantity, and amount.
   5.5. Portfolio and Holdings Screens:  
       - A portfolio screen that displays the overall holdings of the user including the total current value.
       - A separate (or integrated) holdings screen should provide detailed information on each type of asset held.
       - A profit or loss screen shall display the computed profit or loss relative to the initial deposit.

6. Data Integrity and Business Rules Enforcement
   6.1. Negative Balance Prevention:  
       - The system must enforce that a user cannot withdraw an amount that would cause a negative account balance.
   6.2. Overbuy Prevention:  
       - The system must enforce that a user cannot initiate a purchase of shares if the total purchase cost exceeds the available funds.
   6.3. Oversell Prevention:  
       - The system must enforce that a user cannot sell shares if the quantity specified exceeds the number of shares currently held.

7. Integration Details
   7.1. get_share_price(symbol) Function Integration:  
       - The system shall integrate with the provided function get_share_price(symbol) to retrieve current share prices.
