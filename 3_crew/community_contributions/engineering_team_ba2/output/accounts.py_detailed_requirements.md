4. Price Retrieval and Calculation  
   4.1. Integrate with the provided function get_share_price(symbol) to retrieve current prices of shares.  
   4.2. Use the function’s test implementation for fixed prices (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL) during development and testing.  
   4.3. Calculate the current total portfolio value based on the share prices retrieved.  
   4.4. Compute the profit or loss by comparing the current total portfolio value against the initial deposit.

5. Portfolio and Holdings Reporting  
   5.1. Create a “portfolio” screen to display a summary of the user’s current holdings.  
   5.2. Create a “holdings” screen which lists the detailed record of shares owned by the user at any point in time.  
   5.3. Ensure the system can generate on-demand reports displaying the current state of the portfolio.

6. Profit or Loss Reporting  
   6.1. Provide a “profit or loss” screen that reports the user’s profit or loss at any given time.  
   6.2. Ensure that calculations factor in the initial deposit and all subsequent trades to present accurate results.

7. Transaction History  
   7.1. Maintain a complete list of transactions made by the user over time.  
   7.2. Create a “transactions” screen that displays all historical transactions in a chronological order.  
   7.3. Each transaction record should include date, type (buy/sell), share symbol, quantity, and transaction value.

8. User Interface Screens

   8.2. Current Share Price Screen:  
       8.2.1. Display current share prices by integrating with the get_share_price(symbol) function.  
   8.3. Bond Interest Rates Screen:  
       8.3.1. Present current bond interest rates for various maturities – specifically 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year.  
   8.4. Transactions Screen:  
       8.4.1. Provide a detailed view of all user transactions over time.  
   8.5. Portfolio Screen:  
       8.5.1. Display a summary of the current portfolio including total value, holdings, and profit/loss.  
   8.6. Profit or Loss Screen:  
       8.6.1. Isolate and display profit or loss data for quick user reference.  
   8.7. Holdings Screen:  
       8.7.1. Detail the exact shares held by the user along with quantities.  
   8.8. Currency Exchange Screen:  
       8.8.1. Allow users to initiate and perform currency exchange operations between supported currencies.  
   8.9. News Screen:  
       8.9.1. Present the latest financial and market news relevant to the trading simulation platform.  
   8.10. Currency Rates Screen:  
       8.10.1. Display current exchange rates for various currencies.

9. Data Integrity and Error Handling  
   9.1. Enforce validation rules to prevent:  
       9.1.1. Withdrawals that would result in a negative balance.  
       9.1.2. Purchase orders that exceed available funds.  
       9.1.3. Sell orders for shares not held in the account.  
   9.2. Provide clear, user-friendly error messages when validations fail.  
   9.3. Ensure that all financial operations are atomic and consistently update the account state.

10. Testing and Simulation  
    10.1. Include a test suite that verifies the correct integration and behavior of the get_share_price(symbol) function with fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.  
    10.2. Test all user interface screens for proper data display and correct responses to user actions.  
    10.3. Simulate real-world scenarios (edge cases like insufficient funds, invalid sell orders, etc.) to ensure robust error handling and data integrity.

11. Security and Compliance  
    11.1. Ensure secure storage and handling of user credentials and sensitive financial data.  
    11.2. Follow industry best practices for authentication and encryption in all modules.  
    11.3. Validate user sessions and protect each endpoint to mitigate unauthorized access.

This detailed requirements document outlines the full scope of features and validations needed for the trading simulation platform's account management system. The lead engineer should utilize these requirements to design and implement a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that meets all business expectations.
