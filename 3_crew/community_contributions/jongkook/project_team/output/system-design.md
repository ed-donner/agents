# Account Management System Design for Trading Simulation Platform

## Introduction
This document outlines the design for a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. The system supports account creation, deposits and withdrawals of funds, transaction recording for buying and selling shares, and reporting of portfolio values and profit/loss.

## Required Modules
1. **UserAccount**  
   Responsible for managing user accounts, including fund deposits and withdrawals.
2. **Transaction**  
   Manages the recording of transactions and enforces trading rules such as sufficient funds and share ownership.
3. **Portfolio**  
   Handles the reporting of holdings, total value calculation, and profit/loss assessments.
4. **Market**  
   Integrates with market functions, including fetching current share prices.

## Module Details
### 1. UserAccount Module  
#### Classes and Functions:
- `UserAccount`  
  - **Attributes:**
    - `user_id`
    - `balance`
  - **Methods:**
    - `create_account(user_id)` - Creates a new user account.
    - `deposit(amount)` - Increases the balance of the user account.
    - `withdraw(amount)` - Decreases the balance; ensures it does not go negative.

### 2. Transaction Module  
#### Classes and Functions:
- `Transaction`  
  - **Attributes:**
    - `transactions`  
  - **Methods:**
    - `buy_shares(symbol, quantity)` - Records the purchase of shares, checks if sufficient funds are present.
    - `sell_shares(symbol, quantity)` - Records the sale of shares, checks if the user owns a sufficient quantity.

### 3. Portfolio Module  
#### Classes and Functions:
- `Portfolio`  
  - **Attributes:**
    - `holdings`
  - **Methods:**
    - `calculate_total_value()` - Totals the current value of all shares based on market prices.
    - `report_holdings()` - Lists current holdings and their quantities.
    - `assess_profit_loss()` - Calculates and reports profit or loss from the initial deposit.

### 4. Market Module  
#### Functions:
- `get_share_price(symbol)`  
  - **Description:** Fetches the current price of a share based on the symbol provided. This function is critical during transactions for checking share prices.

## Conclusion
This design outlines the necessary modules with their respective functionalities to achieve user account management in a trading platform simulation. Each module focuses on specific areas ensuring clarity and separation of concerns.

## Next Steps
Implement the modules as specified, ensuring proper testing and validation of functionality to create a robust trading simulation experience.
