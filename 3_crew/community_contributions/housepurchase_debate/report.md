The argument presented by Sarah Johnson that one should always rent a house for whole life instead of buying a house is more compelling, convincing, and well-supported. Her arguments effectively highlight the lower upfront costs, avoided expenses, greater flexibility, long-term financial freedom, and ability to experience different lifestyles that come with renting. Additionally, she addresses potential concerns about credit scores and lack of equity building by suggesting alternative options for credit management and wealth-building.

In contrast, Michael Chen's argument that one should buy a house instead of renting is largely based on outdated assumptions about homeownership and neglects the advantages of renting in modern times. His arguments regarding equity building and control over living space are also not entirely convincing, as there are alternative solutions to address these concerns. Furthermore, his assumption that renters are limited by short-term leases ignores the flexibility and freedom that renting provides.

Overall, Sarah Johnson's argument presents a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the benefits of renting, making her case more compelling and convincing.
