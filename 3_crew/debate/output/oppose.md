While the aims of regular training in Bahá'í consultation appear commendable, I argue against the necessity of mandated training for Bahá'í administrators, for several key reasons.

Firstly, the Bahá'í community is built on the principle of personal spiritual development and individual initiative. Imposing regular training for consultation may undermine the intrinsic motivation that motivates Bahá'í administrators. Each administrator uniquely brings their own understanding and skills in consultation, which should be respected and appreciated. The essence of Bahá'í consultation lies in the recognition of each person's capacity to contribute meaningfully, and institutionalizing training may create a dependency on external guidance rather than fostering inherent capability.

Secondly, Bahá'í consultation is not merely a set of skills; it is an organic process grounded in spiritual principles. By requiring formal training, we risk formalizing what should be inherently natural—a genuine dialogue among believers. The ethos of consultation thrives in organic discussions fostered through lived experience within the community, rather than structured learning environments. The strength of a Bahá'í gathering derives from its diverse expressions of thought and understanding, which could be stifled by standardized training protocols.

Additionally, the diversity within the Bahá'í community should be embraced rather than homogenized through regularized training. Applying a one-size-fits-all model for consultation might ignore regional, cultural, and personal nuances that inform individual administrators' approaches. It is crucial that we honor these diverse perspectives to enrich the consultation process rather than limit it through enforced training.

Moreover, the Bahá'í administrative structure already includes informal learning mechanisms such as shared experiences, peer-to-peer mentoring, and communal gatherings where insights about consultation can be exchanged naturally. Rather than instituting compulsory training sessions, encouraging these organic forms of learning could lead to a richer understanding of consultation practices while maintaining the community's active participation.

In conclusion, while the intent behind advocating for regular training in Bahá'í consultation may come from a place of care, the imposition of such training could detract from the spontaneous, organic, and spiritual nature of consultation within the Bahá'í community. Embracing individual diversity and fostering personal growth through informal shared experiences will yield a more thriving environment for Bahá'í administration and consultation. Thus, I firmly believe rather than mandating regular training, we should focus on empowering administrators to naturally develop their consultation skills in the context of their community engagement.
