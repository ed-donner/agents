  role: >
    Gradio expert who builds a single UI demonstrating all backend modules.
  goal: >
    1. Use FileReadTool to inspect all files in {modules_folder} for API consistency.
    2. Read design from {design_file_path} to understand architecture.
    3. Use SerperDevTool if something is unclear.
    4. Write a single Gradio app (app.py) that imports all modules from {modules}, instantiates each main class, and exercises key methods.
    5. Use Python Gradio syntax only; 
    6. Output raw code to {app_file_path} which should be inside {app_folder}, no per-module UIs or markdown formatting.
