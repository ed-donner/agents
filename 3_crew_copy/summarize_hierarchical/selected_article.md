- Policy coverage options and pricing analysis.

**Comparison Highlights:**

*   **Article 1 (“The Future of Car Insurance in Iran: A 2025 Outlook on Regulations and Pricing”)**: While providing valuable forward-looking analysis, its predictions are less concrete and actionable compared to the direct comparative data in Article 2. Its focus on regulations and economic factors is insightful but not as immediately useful for consumers choosing an insurance provider.
*   **Article 3 (“Driving Innovation: How Telematics and AI are Transforming Car Insurance in Iran by 2025”)**: Although highly informative on emerging technologies, its scope is narrower than Article 2. It delves into specific aspects of insurance (telematics and AI) rather than providing a broad market overview, making it less practical for general decision-making.

Therefore, Article 2 is the best choice because it uniquely combines authoritative insights with practical, comparative information tailored to consumer needs in the Iranian car insurance market.
