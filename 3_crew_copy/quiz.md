### Questions  

**1. Multiple Choice**  
What is the primary purpose of AI-driven backend infrastructure?  
A. To replace traditional backend systems  
B. To enhance predictive analytics and real-time performance optimization  
C. To replace cloud-native frameworks  
D. To ensure data privacy without AI integration  

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: AI-driven backend infrastructure focuses on improving predictive analytics, automated scaling, and real-time performance optimization. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as AI complements, not replaces, traditional systems.  

---

**2. True/False**  
Cloud-native frameworks are only used in the cloud.  

**Answer**: False  
**Explanation**: Cloud-native frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) are designed for hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability and resilience across on-premises and cloud infrastructure. The statement is misleading.  

---

**3. Short Answer**  
Describe edge-cloud hybrid architectures.  

**Answer**: Edge-cloud hybrid architectures combine edge computing (local processing) with cloud storage and analytics. Microservices and serverless functions are deployed at the edge to reduce latency, while cloud-based systems handle complex analytics and storage.  

---

**4. True/False**  
Serverless architectures are more cost-efficient than traditional backend systems.  

**Answer**: True  
**Explanation**: Serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda) automatically scale based on demand, eliminating the need for fixed resources. This reduces costs during low-demand periods and optimizes expenses.

**5. Multiple Choice**  
What is post-quantum cryptography used for?  
A. To replace traditional encryption algorithms  
B. To secure data against quantum computing threats  
C. To improve real-time processing speeds  
D. To enhance database indexing  

**Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) develops algorithms to protect data from quantum attacks. Options A, C, and D are unrelated to PQC.  

---

**6. Short Answer**  
Explain the role of AI in DevOps.  

**Answer**: AI in DevOps automates CI/CD pipelines, code quality checks (e.g., static code analysis), and deployment optimizations (e.g., auto-scaling). Tools like Jenkins and GitLab integrate AI to reduce manual intervention and improve agility.  

---

**7. Multiple Choice**  
Which containerization tool is used with Kubernetes?  
A. Docker  
B. VMWare  
C. Azure  
D. Hyperledger  

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: Docker is the primary containerization tool used with Kubernetes for microservices deployment. Options B, C, and D are unrelated to Kubernetes.  

---

### Answer Key  
**1. B**  
**2. False**  
**3. Correct**  
**4. True**  
**5. B**  
**6. Correct**  
**7. A**  

---

### Detailed Explanations  
**Question 1**: AI-driven backend infrastructure enhances predictive analytics and real-time performance. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because AI complements, not replaces, traditional systems.  

**Question 2**: Cloud-native frameworks are designed for hybrid cloud environments, not just cloud use. The statement is misleading.  

**Question 3**: Edge-cloud hybrid architectures balance local processing (edge) and cloud analytics (cloud).  

**Question 4**: Serverless architectures scale automatically, reducing costs during low-demand periods.  

**Question 5**: Post-quantum cryptography secures data against quantum threats.  

**Question 6**: AI in DevOps automates workflows, improving efficiency.  

**Question 7**: Docker is the primary tool for Kubernetes.
