   **Correct Answer:** A  
   **Explanation:** Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to manage containerized applications in cloud environments.  
   **Scoring:** 1/1

5. **What is the primary advantage of edge computing in backend services?**  
   A. Reduced latency and real-time processing  
   B. Increased complexity in infrastructure management  
   C. Limited scalability for large-scale applications  
   D. Enhanced security for cloud-based data  
   **Correct Answer:** A  
   **Explanation:** Edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the user, enabling low-latency, real-time processing.  
   **Scoring:** 1/1

### True/False Questions (2 questions)
6. **True or False: Serverless architecture requires developers to manage infrastructure.**  
   **Correct Answer:** False  
   **Explanation:** Serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on logic.  
   **Scoring:** 1/1

7. **True or False: Kubernetes is a database system optimized for real-time data processing.**  
   **Correct Answer:** False  
   **Explanation:** Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool, not a database system.  
   **Scoring:** 1/1

### Short Answer Questions (2 questions)
8. **Explain the role of AI in DevOps tools.**  
   **Correct Answer:** AI in DevOps tools automates testing, code quality analysis, and infrastructure as code (IaC) deployment, streamlining workflows.  
   **Scoring:** 1/1

9. **What is the purpose of hybrid cloud solutions in backend systems?**  
   **Correct Answer:** Hybrid cloud solutions combine on-premise infrastructure with cloud scalability, enabling flexibility and cost efficiency.
