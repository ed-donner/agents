    "2- After step1 above, you'll have the HF link to your deplyed app (e.g. https://inoussa-guru-career-conversations.hf.space).\n",
    "\n",
    "3- We'll use this link to embed the web component into our website (index.html). This approach offers a better experience than IFrame as it does not slow down the loading time and the UI automatically adjusts its height based on the size of the Gradio app.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Open the index.html and create a new section/component where you'd like to add the chatbot to answer your career questions from the visitors. Below is a simple section I created for my case. Make sure to replace 5.49.2 in the Gradion S3 URL with the library version of Gradio you are using.\n",
