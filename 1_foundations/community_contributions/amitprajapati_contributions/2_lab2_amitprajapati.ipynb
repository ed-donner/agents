The kth element in the sorted array would be our desired kth largest element.\\n\\nPython code:\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    nums.sort(reverse=True)\\n    return nums[k-1]\\n```\\n\\nTime complexity:  \\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) where n is the length of the input array. This is because the sort operation takes n log n time.\\n\\nSpace complexity:  \\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.\\n\\nWhy is this not optimal?  \\nAlthough the solution works correctly, the time complexity is not as efficient as it could be. The problem statement specifically asks for a solution that works in O(n) time on average. The brute force solution does not satisfy this requirement.\\n\\nSolution 2: Optimal Approach: \\nThe optimal solution to this problem can be solved using a heap or a priority queue. A priority queue always keep the largest element at the top (max heap). We will iterate through our array and maintain a min heap of exactly k elements where the top of the heap (the smallest element of the heap) is our kth largest element. This approach ensures that our heap always has the k largest elements of the array we have seen so far.\\n\\nPython code:\\n```python\\nimport heapq\\n\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    return heapq.nlargest(k, nums)[-1]\\n```\\n\\nTime complexity:  \\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log k) where n is the length of the input array. This is because for each element, the heapify operation can take up to log k time.\\n\\nSpace complexity:  \\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(k) as we are using a heap to store up to k elements.\\n\\nWhy is this optimal?  \\nThis solution is optimal because it reduces the time complexity to O(n log k). The solution only maintains a heap of k elements and only heapifies k elements which significantly optimizes the solution from the brute force approach. Even though it’s worst case time complexity is O(n log k) but for smaller values of k, it can perform significantly better than the brute force method.', '**Solution 1: Brute Force**\\n\\nIn the brute force solution, we simply sort the given array nums in decreasing order and return the k-th element.\\n\\nPython code for this solution is:\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargestBrute(nums, k):\\n    return sorted(nums, reverse=True)[k-1]\\n```\\nThis solution is not optimal because it takes O(nlogn) time to sort the array, and O(1) additional space. The problem statement requires solving the problem in O(n) time, so this solution does not meet this constraint.\\n\\n**Solution 2: Optimal**\\n\\nThe optimal solution uses the \"Quickselect\" algorithm, a derivative of the QuickSort algorithm. It reduces the problem space by half in each recursive iteration until finding the k-th largest element.\\n\\nPython code for this solution is:\\n```python\\nimport random\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    def quickselect(start, end, k):\\n        if start == end:\\n            return nums[start]\\n        pivot = random.randint(start, end)\\n        nums[start], nums[pivot] = nums[pivot], nums[start]\\n        i = start\\n        for j in range(start+1, end+1):\\n            if nums[j] > nums[start]:\\n                i += 1\\n                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\\n        nums[i], nums[start] = nums[start], nums[i]\\n        if k < i:\\n            return quickselect(start, i-1, k)\\n        elif k > i:\\n            return quickselect(i+1, end, k)\\n        else:\\n            return nums[i]\\n    return quickselect(0, len(nums)-1, k-1)\\n```\\n\\n\"Why is the optimal solution optimal?\"\\n\\nThis optimal solution does not need to fully sort the array. Instead, it just finds the k-th largest element. It has an average time complexity of O(n), which makes it fit the problem constraints, and worst-case scenario O(n^2) when the selected pivot is the smallest or largest element. But the latter issue is generally avoided by using a random pivot.\\n\\n\"Why is the brute force solution not optimal?\"\\n\\nThe brute force solution sorts the entire array, which takes O(nlogn) time, not as efficient as the optimal solution. Also, there is unnecessary work in sorting all elements when we only care about the k-th largest.\\n\\nTime and Space complexity:\\n\\n1. The brute force solution has a time complexity of O(nlogn) for sorting and space complexity is O(1) excluding the input space.\\n\\n2. The optimal solution has an average time complexity of O(n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). The space complexity is O(n) due to recursion stack space.', \"Certainly! Below are the two solutions to the problem of finding the k-th largest element in an array, along with explanations about their efficiencies, time complexities, and space complexities.\\n\\n### 1. Brute Force Solution\\n\\n**Approach:**\\nThe brute force approach involves sorting the input array and then selecting the k-th largest element from the sorted array.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n1. Sort the array in descending order.\\n2. Return the element at index `k-1`.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    nums.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order\\n    return nums[k - 1]       # Return the k-th largest element\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:**\\n- Sorting the array takes \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is the length of the input array. Retrieving the element is \\\\(O(1)\\\\).\\n- Overall time complexity is \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\).\\n\\n**Space Complexity:**\\n- The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) for in-place sorting (if you're not considering the recursive stack space for non-in-place sorting), or \\\\(O(n)\\\\) if we consider the space needed for creating a new sorted array.\\n\\n**Why it is not optimal:**\\n- The brute force solution is not optimal because sorting the entire array is unnecessary for finding the k-th largest element. This approach takes more time as it scales with the log factor, making it unsuitable for larger arrays, especially when \\\\(n\\\\) is close to \\\\(10^5\\\\).\\n\\n### 2. Optimal Solution (Using Quickselect)\\n\\n**Approach:**\\nAn optimal solution can be achieved using the Quickselect algorithm, which is a selection algorithm based on the partitioning logic of QuickSort. It can find the k-th largest element in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time on average.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n1. Choose a pivot element from the array.\\n2. Partition the array into two subarrays: elements greater than the pivot and elements less than or equal to the pivot.\\n3. Determine the size of the subarray containing the k-th largest element and recurse into the appropriate subarray.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```python\\nimport random\\n\\ndef quickselect(nums, left, right, k):\\n    pivot = random.randint(left, right)\\n    # Move pivot to the end\\n    nums[pivot], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot]\\n    \\n    # Partitioning\\n    pivot_index = left\\n    for i in range(left, right):\\n        if nums[i] > nums[right]:  # We want the k-th largest\\n            nums[i], nums[pivot_index] = nums[pivot_index], nums[i]\\n            pivot_index += 1\\n    # Move pivot to its final place\\n    nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]\\n    \\n    # Check the position of the pivot\\n    if pivot_index == k - 1:\\n        return nums[pivot_index]\\n    elif pivot_index < k - 1:\\n        return quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, right, k)  # Go right\\n    else:\\n        return quickselect(nums, left, pivot_index - 1, k)     # Go left\\n\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    return quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, k)\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:**\\n- Average case \\\\(O(n)\\\\) due to the partitioning, but the worst-case time complexity can degrade to \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) if the pivot chosen is consistently the smallest or largest element (though this is rare with randomization).\\n\\n**Space Complexity:**\\n- The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) for iterative implementations or \\\\(O(log n)\\\\) for depth of the recursive stack.\\n\\n**Why it is optimal:**\\n- The Quickselect algorithm achieves linear time complexity on average by only partially sorting the array, directly targeting the k-th largest element without the necessity of sorting the entire array, thus making it much more efficient for large datasets. The utilization of a randomized pivot further minimizes the chance of worst-case performance, maintaining the average linear time complexity.\\n\\n### Summary:\\n- **Brute-force approach**: Time Complexity: \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\), Space Complexity: \\\\(O(1)\\\\) or \\\\(O(n)\\\\) (depending on sorting method). Not optimal due to unnecessary full sorting.\\n- **Optimal approach**: Time Complexity: Average \\\\(O(n)\\\\), Worst \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\). Space Complexity: \\\\(O(1)\\\\) or \\\\(O(log n)\\\\). Optimal because it finds the k-th largest element without sorting the whole array.\", 'Sure! Here are the two solutions for the given LeetCode-style problem:\\n\\n1) Brute Force Solution:\\n- In the brute force solution, we can sort the array and then return the k-th largest element.\\n- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.\\n- Space Complexity: O(1) if we sort the array in-place, otherwise O(n) for the sorted array.\\n- This solution is not optimal because sorting the entire array takes n log n time, which is not the required O(n) time complexity.\\n\\n2) Optimal Solution (Using QuickSelect Algorithm):\\n- The optimal solution for this problem is to use the quickselect algorithm, which is similar to quicksort but focuses on partitioning the array to find the k-th largest element without sorting the entire array.\\n- Time Complexity: O(n) on average, as we partition the array and only recurse on one side of the partition, reducing the search space to half each time.\\n- Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.\\n- The optimal solution is efficient as it utilizes the partitioning concept of quicksort and only recurses on one side of the partition based on the comparison with the target k, resulting in an average time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nIn summary, the optimal solution using the quickselect algorithm is preferred for this problem because it achieves the required O(n) time complexity on average by intelligently partitioning the array and focusing on the search space based on the value of k. On the other hand, the brute force solution is not optimal as it sorts the entire array, resulting in a higher time complexity.', \"Brute Force Solution:\\nTo find the Kth largest element in an array using a brute force approach, we can first sort the array in descending order and then return the element at index k-1. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space.\\n\\nOptimal Solution:\\nOne optimal approach to find the Kth largest element is by using a min-heap of size k. We can iterate through the array, maintaining a min-heap of the k largest elements seen so far. This way, the root of the min-heap will always be the Kth largest element. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log k) since each insertion into the min-heap takes O(log k) time, and we are doing this for each element in the array. The space complexity is O(k) to store the k largest elements in the min-heap.\\n\\nReasons for the optimal solution being optimal:\\n1. The optimal solution has a time complexity of O(n log k), which is more efficient than the brute force solution's O(n log n), especially for large values of k.\\n2. By using a min-heap, we only need to maintain the k largest elements seen so far, reducing the space complexity compared to sorting the entire array.\\n\\nIn summary, the optimal solution using a min-heap is more efficient than the brute force solution because it reduces both time and space complexity by only focusing on the k largest elements, rather than sorting the entire array.\", \"To solve the problem of finding the k-th largest element in an array, we can consider two approaches: a brute force solution and an optimal solution. Here's how each can be implemented, along with an analysis of their time and space complexities.\\n\\n### Brute Force Solution\\n\\n**Approach:**\\n\\n1. **Sort the Array:** First, sort the array in descending order.\\n2. **Select the k-th Largest Element:** Since the array is sorted, simply return the element at index `k-1`.\\n\\n**Implementation (in Python):**\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    nums.sort(reverse=True)\\n    return nums[k-1]\\n\\n# Example usage:\\n# nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2\\n# Output: 5\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\n- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\) due to the sorting step, where \\\\(n\\\\) is the length of the array.\\n- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) if the sorting is done in-place, otherwise it could be \\\\(O(n)\\\\) if using an auxiliary data structure for sorting.\\n\\n**Why it's not optimal:** Sorting the entire array when we only need the k-th largest element is not necessary and inefficient in terms of time complexity, especially for large arrays.\\n\\n### Optimal Solution\\n\\n**Approach:**\\n\\n1. **Use Quickselect Algorithm:** Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an unordered list, similar to QuickSort. It works by partitioning the array around a pivot element and recursively selecting the desired k-th element.\\n2. **Quickselect (Modified for k-th Largest):** We'll modify it for the k-th largest by considering the pivot's index in descending order.\\n\\n**Implementation (in Python):**\\n```python\\ndef partition(nums, left, right):\\n    pivot = nums[right]\\n    store_index = left\\n    for i in range(left, right):\\n        if nums[i] > pivot: # Change this to > for k-th largest\\n            nums[i], nums[store_index] = nums[store_index], nums[i]\\n            store_index += 1\\n    nums[store_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[store_index]\\n    return store_index\\n\\ndef quickselect(nums, left, right, k_smallest):\\n    if left == right:\\n        return nums[left]\\n\\n    pivot_index = partition(nums, left, right)\\n\\n    if k_smallest == pivot_index:\\n        return nums[k_smallest]\\n    elif k_smallest < pivot_index:\\n        return quickselect(nums, left, pivot_index - 1, k_smallest)\\n    else:\\n        return quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, right, k_smallest)\\n\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    return quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, k - 1)\\n\\n# Example usage:\\n# nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2\\n# Output: 5\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\n- **Time Complexity:** The average time complexity of Quickselect is \\\\(O(n)\\\\), although in the worst-case scenario (which is rare), it can degrade to \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\).\\n- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) as changes are done in-place.\\n\\n**Why it's optimal:** The Quickselect algorithm is optimal because it avoids sorting the entire array, instead, it efficiently narrows down the search to the k-th largest element, giving it an average-case time complexity of \\\\(O(n)\\\\), which is much better than sorting.\\n\\nIn summary, while the brute force method is straightforward, the optimal solution using Quickselect is more efficient for large input sizes due to its average \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time complexity.\"]\n"

The kth element in the sorted array would be our desired kth largest element.\\n\\nPython code:\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    nums.sort(reverse=True)\\n    return nums[k-1]\\n```\\n\\nTime complexity:  \\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) where n is the length of the input array. This is because the sort operation takes n log n time.\\n\\nSpace complexity:  \\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.\\n\\nWhy is this not optimal?  \\nAlthough the solution works correctly, the time complexity is not as efficient as it could be. The problem statement specifically asks for a solution that works in O(n) time on average. The brute force solution does not satisfy this requirement.\\n\\nSolution 2: Optimal Approach: \\nThe optimal solution to this problem can be solved using a heap or a priority queue. A priority queue always keep the largest element at the top (max heap). We will iterate through our array and maintain a min heap of exactly k elements where the top of the heap (the smallest element of the heap) is our kth largest element. This approach ensures that our heap always has the k largest elements of the array we have seen so far.\\n\\nPython code:\\n```python\\nimport heapq\\n\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    return heapq.nlargest(k, nums)[-1]\\n```\\n\\nTime complexity:  \\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log k) where n is the length of the input array. This is because for each element, the heapify operation can take up to log k time.\\n\\nSpace complexity:  \\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(k) as we are using a heap to store up to k elements.\\n\\nWhy is this optimal?  \\nThis solution is optimal because it reduces the time complexity to O(n log k). The solution only maintains a heap of k elements and only heapifies k elements which significantly optimizes the solution from the brute force approach. Even though it’s worst case time complexity is O(n log k) but for smaller values of k, it can perform significantly better than the brute force method.\\n\\n# Response from competitor 2\\n\\n**Solution 1: Brute Force**\\n\\nIn the brute force solution, we simply sort the given array nums in decreasing order and return the k-th element.\\n\\nPython code for this solution is:\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargestBrute(nums, k):\\n    return sorted(nums, reverse=True)[k-1]\\n```\\nThis solution is not optimal because it takes O(nlogn) time to sort the array, and O(1) additional space. The problem statement requires solving the problem in O(n) time, so this solution does not meet this constraint.\\n\\n**Solution 2: Optimal**\\n\\nThe optimal solution uses the \"Quickselect\" algorithm, a derivative of the QuickSort algorithm. It reduces the problem space by half in each recursive iteration until finding the k-th largest element.\\n\\nPython code for this solution is:\\n```python\\nimport random\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    def quickselect(start, end, k):\\n        if start == end:\\n            return nums[start]\\n        pivot = random.randint(start, end)\\n        nums[start], nums[pivot] = nums[pivot], nums[start]\\n        i = start\\n        for j in range(start+1, end+1):\\n            if nums[j] > nums[start]:\\n                i += 1\\n                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\\n        nums[i], nums[start] = nums[start], nums[i]\\n        if k < i:\\n            return quickselect(start, i-1, k)\\n        elif k > i:\\n            return quickselect(i+1, end, k)\\n        else:\\n            return nums[i]\\n    return quickselect(0, len(nums)-1, k-1)\\n```\\n\\n\"Why is the optimal solution optimal?\"\\n\\nThis optimal solution does not need to fully sort the array. Instead, it just finds the k-th largest element. It has an average time complexity of O(n), which makes it fit the problem constraints, and worst-case scenario O(n^2) when the selected pivot is the smallest or largest element. But the latter issue is generally avoided by using a random pivot.\\n\\n\"Why is the brute force solution not optimal?\"\\n\\nThe brute force solution sorts the entire array, which takes O(nlogn) time, not as efficient as the optimal solution. Also, there is unnecessary work in sorting all elements when we only care about the k-th largest.\\n\\nTime and Space complexity:\\n\\n1. The brute force solution has a time complexity of O(nlogn) for sorting and space complexity is O(1) excluding the input space.\\n\\n2. The optimal solution has an average time complexity of O(n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). The space complexity is O(n) due to recursion stack space.\\n\\n# Response from competitor 3\\n\\nCertainly! Below are the two solutions to the problem of finding the k-th largest element in an array, along with explanations about their efficiencies, time complexities, and space complexities.\\n\\n### 1. Brute Force Solution\\n\\n**Approach:**\\nThe brute force approach involves sorting the input array and then selecting the k-th largest element from the sorted array.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n1. Sort the array in descending order.\\n2. Return the element at index `k-1`.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```python\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    nums.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order\\n    return nums[k - 1]       # Return the k-th largest element\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:**\\n- Sorting the array takes \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is the length of the input array. Retrieving the element is \\\\(O(1)\\\\).\\n- Overall time complexity is \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\).\\n\\n**Space Complexity:**\\n- The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) for in-place sorting (if you\\'re not considering the recursive stack space for non-in-place sorting), or \\\\(O(n)\\\\) if we consider the space needed for creating a new sorted array.\\n\\n**Why it is not optimal:**\\n- The brute force solution is not optimal because sorting the entire array is unnecessary for finding the k-th largest element. This approach takes more time as it scales with the log factor, making it unsuitable for larger arrays, especially when \\\\(n\\\\) is close to \\\\(10^5\\\\).\\n\\n### 2. Optimal Solution (Using Quickselect)\\n\\n**Approach:**\\nAn optimal solution can be achieved using the Quickselect algorithm, which is a selection algorithm based on the partitioning logic of QuickSort. It can find the k-th largest element in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time on average.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n1. Choose a pivot element from the array.\\n2. Partition the array into two subarrays: elements greater than the pivot and elements less than or equal to the pivot.\\n3. Determine the size of the subarray containing the k-th largest element and recurse into the appropriate subarray.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```python\\nimport random\\n\\ndef quickselect(nums, left, right, k):\\n    pivot = random.randint(left, right)\\n    # Move pivot to the end\\n    nums[pivot], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot]\\n    \\n    # Partitioning\\n    pivot_index = left\\n    for i in range(left, right):\\n        if nums[i] > nums[right]:  # We want the k-th largest\\n            nums[i], nums[pivot_index] = nums[pivot_index], nums[i]\\n            pivot_index += 1\\n    # Move pivot to its final place\\n    nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]\\n    \\n    # Check the position of the pivot\\n    if pivot_index == k - 1:\\n        return nums[pivot_index]\\n    elif pivot_index < k - 1:\\n        return quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, right, k)  # Go right\\n    else:\\n        return quickselect(nums, left, pivot_index - 1, k)     # Go left\\n\\ndef findKthLargest(nums, k):\\n    return quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, k)\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:**\\n- Average case \\\\(O(n)\\\\) due to the partitioning, but the worst-case time complexity can degrade to \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) if the pivot chosen is consistently the smallest or largest element (though this is rare with randomization).\\n\\n**Space Complexity:**\\n- The space complexity is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) for iterative implementations or \\\\(O(log n)\\\\) for depth of the recursive stack.\\n\\n**Why it is optimal:**\\n- The Quickselect algorithm achieves linear time complexity on average by only partially sorting the array, directly targeting the k-th largest element without the necessity of sorting the entire array, thus making it much more efficient for large datasets. The utilization of a randomized pivot further minimizes the chance of worst-case performance, maintaining the average linear time complexity.\\n\\n### Summary:\\n- **Brute-force approach**: Time Complexity: \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\), Space Complexity: \\\\(O(1)\\\\) or \\\\(O(n)\\\\) (depending on sorting method). Not optimal due to unnecessary full sorting.\\n- **Optimal approach**: Time Complexity: Average \\\\(O(n)\\\\), Worst \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\). Space Complexity: \\\\(O(1)\\\\) or \\\\(O(log n)\\\\). Optimal because it finds the k-th largest element without sorting the whole array.\\n\\n# Response from competitor 4\\n\\nSure! Here are the two solutions for the given LeetCode-style problem:\\n\\n1) Brute Force Solution:\\n- In the brute force solution, we can sort the array and then return the k-th largest element.\\n- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.\\n- Space Complexity: O(1) if we sort the array in-place, otherwise O(n) for the sorted array.\\n- This solution is not optimal because sorting the entire array takes n log n time, which is not the required O(n) time complexity.\\n\\n2) Optimal Solution (Using QuickSelect Algorithm):\\n- The optimal solution for this problem is to use the quickselect algorithm, which is similar to quicksort but focuses on partitioning the array to find the k-th largest element without sorting the entire array.\\n- Time Complexity: O(n) on average, as we partition the array and only recurse on one side of the partition, reducing the search space to half each time.\\n- Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.\\n- The optimal solution is efficient as it utilizes the partitioning concept of quicksort and only recurses on one side of the partition based on the comparison with the target k, resulting in an average time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nIn summary, the optimal solution using the quickselect algorithm is preferred for this problem because it achieves the required O(n) time complexity on average by intelligently partitioning the array and focusing on the search space based on the value of k. On the other hand, the brute force solution is not optimal as it sorts the entire array, resulting in a higher time complexity.\\n\\n# Response from competitor 5\\n\\nBrute Force Solution:\\nTo find the Kth largest element in an array using a brute force approach, we can first sort the array in descending order and then return the element at index k-1. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space.\\n\\nOptimal Solution:\\nOne optimal approach to find the Kth largest element is by using a min-heap of size k. We can iterate through the array, maintaining a min-heap of the k largest elements seen so far. This way, the root of the min-heap will always be the Kth largest element. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log k) since each insertion into the min-heap takes O(log k) time, and we are doing this for each element in the array. The space complexity is O(k) to store the k largest elements in the min-heap.\\n\\nReasons for the optimal solution being optimal:\\n1. The optimal solution has a time complexity of O(n log k), which is more efficient than the brute force solution\\'s O(n log n), especially for large values of k.\\n2. By using a min-heap, we only need to maintain the k largest elements seen so far, reducing the space complexity compared to sorting the entire array.\\n\\nIn summary, the optimal solution using a min-heap is more efficient than the brute force solution because it reduces both time and space complexity by only focusing on the k largest elements, rather than sorting the entire array.\\n\\n# Response from competitor 6\\n\\nTo solve the problem of finding the k-th largest element in an array, we can consider two approaches: a brute force solution and an optimal solution.
