    "## Conclusion: Prompt Chaining for LPP Classification\n",

    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "A 5-step sequential pipeline for Australian Legal Professional Privilege classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Analysis | Output |\n",
    "|------|----------|--------|\n",
    "| 1 | Identify parties | Sender, recipient, roles |\n",
    "| 2 | Lawyer involved? | Yes/No + reasoning |\n",
    "| 3 | Legal advice sought/given? | Dominant purpose test |\n",
    "| 4 | Confidential? | Waiver risk assessment |\n",
    "| 5 | Final determination | Classification + confidence |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Prompt Chaining Works for Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auditable:** Each step is logged and traceable\n",
    "- **Mirrors legal reasoning:** Follows how a lawyer analyses privilege\n",
    "- **Defensible:** Can explain exactly why a document was classified\n",
    "- **HITL ready:** CSV export for senior lawyer review and sign-off\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed steps may not suit all document types**\n",
    "- This pipeline assumes a standard email format\n",
    "- Board minutes, file notes, or multi-party correspondence may need different analysis steps\n",
    "- Documents with complex attachment hierarchies (email with attachment that itself contains attachments) don't fit neatly into this linear flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex email chains may need dynamic analysis**\n",
    "- A 50-message email thread with multiple parties joining and leaving requires adaptive analysis\n",
    "- The Orchestrator-Worker pattern (Notebook 04) breaks down such documents dynamically rather than forcing them through fixed steps\n",
    "- Some documents need more steps, some need fewer - chaining can't adjust\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single model - no consensus checking**\n",
    "- We're trusting one model's judgment entirely\n",
    "- A hallucination or misinterpretation has no safety net\n",
    "- The Parallelization pattern (Notebook 03) runs multiple models and flags disagreements\n",
    "- For high-stakes privilege decisions, consensus from 2-3 models is more defensible\n",
