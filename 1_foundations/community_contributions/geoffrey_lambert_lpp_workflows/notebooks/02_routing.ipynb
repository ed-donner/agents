    "\n",
    "Routing directs incoming documents to specialised classifiers based on document type. Instead of one generic classifier handling everything, each document type gets expert analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use it for privilege review?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real discovery datasets contain mixed document types:\n",
    "- Emails between lawyers and clients\n",
    "- Internal business emails\n",
    "- Board minutes and resolutions\n",
    "- File notes and attendance memos\n",
    "- Financial spreadsheets\n",
    "- HR documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type has different privilege indicators. An email needs party analysis; a board minute needs \"legal advice\" agenda item detection; a file note needs author role analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion: Routing for LPP Classification\n",

    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "A document routing system that directs documents to specialist classifiers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Document → Router → What type?\n",
    "                ↓\n",
    "    ┌───────────┼───────────┐\n",
    "    ↓           ↓           ↓\n",
    "  EMAIL    BOARD_MINUTE  FILE_NOTE\n",
    "Classifier  Classifier   Classifier\n",
    "    ↓           ↓           ↓\n",
    "  Result     Result      Result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Routing Works for Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialist knowledge:** Each classifier is tuned for its document type\n",
    "- **Better accuracy:** Email analysis differs from board minute analysis\n",
    "- **Partial privilege:** Board minute classifier detected mixed content that a generic classifier might miss\n",
    "- **Extensible:** Easy to add new document types (contracts, briefs, letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Prompt Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Prompt Chaining | Routing |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|---------|\n",
    "| Structure | Fixed sequential steps | Branch by document type |\n",
    "| Best for | Single document type | Mixed document sets |\n",
    "| Flexibility | Same analysis for all | Tailored per type |\n",
    "| Complexity | Simpler | Requires multiple classifiers |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Router accuracy is critical**\n",
    "- If the router misclassifies a document, it goes to the wrong specialist\n",
    "- A misrouted file note analysed as an email would miss key privilege indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintaining multiple classifiers**\n",
    "- Each classifier needs to be updated if law changes\n",
    "- More code to maintain than a single classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unknown document types**\n",
    "- Documents that don't fit categories need a fallback or manual review\n",
    "- The \"OTHER\" category is a catch-all that may need human intervention\n",
