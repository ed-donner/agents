    "\n",
    "## What is Evaluator-Optimizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern generates an initial output, then uses a second LLM pass to critique and improve it. This creates a feedback loop where the model reflects on its own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use it for privilege review?\n",
    "\n",
    "Privilege decisions have serious consequences:\n",
    "- First-pass classifications may miss nuances\n",
    "- Self-critique catches errors before human review\n",
    "- Documented reasoning shows the analysis was thorough\n",
    "- Mirrors senior lawyer reviewing junior lawyer's work\n",

    "- **Catches errors:** Self-critique found the waiver issue the generator missed\n",
    "- **Reduces false confidence:** Confidence dropped from 85% to 70% appropriately\n",
    "- **Audit trail:** Shows exactly how the conclusion was reached\n",
    "- **Mirrors legal practice:** Senior lawyer reviewing junior lawyer's work\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Observed\n",

    "| Stage | Classification | Confidence | Waiver Found |\n",
    "|-------|---------------|------------|--------------|\n",

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-critique isn't infallible**\n",
