    "\n",
    "## What is Orchestrator-Worker?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Orchestrator-Worker pattern uses one LLM (the orchestrator) to analyse a complex task and break it into subtasks. It then delegates each subtask to worker LLMs, and finally combines the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use it for privilege review?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some documents are too complex for fixed pipelines:\n",
    "- Long email chains with 20+ messages\n",
    "- Documents with multiple attachments\n",
    "- Mixed content with privileged and non-privileged sections\n",
    "- Complex corporate structures with multiple parties\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator dynamically decides what analysis is needed based on the specific document.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Orchestrator-Worker Works for Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic:** Adapts to document complexity - simple docs get fewer subtasks\n",
    "- **Thorough:** Each aspect analysed by a focused worker\n",
    "- **Catches nuance:** Worker 5 identified the waiver issue from CC'ing non-lawyers\n",
    "- **Auditable:** Each worker's finding is logged separately\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "| Worker | Finding |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| 1 | 4 emails, 2 attachments catalogued |\n",
    "| 2 | Mix of legal and corporate parties |\n",
    "| 3 | Emails 1&2 privileged, 3&4 factual |\n",
    "| 4 | Draft response privileged, letter of demand not |\n",
    "| 5 | **Potential waiver** - advice shared with CFO/CEO |\n",
    "\n",
    "The waiver issue is exactly what this pattern is designed to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Other Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Prompt Chaining | Routing | Parallelization | Orchestrator-Worker |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Structure | Fixed steps | Branch by type | Same task, multiple models | Dynamic breakdown |\n",
    "| Best for | Simple docs | Mixed types | High-stakes decisions | Complex docs |\n",
    "| Adaptability | None | Limited | None | High |\n",
    "| Subtask count | Fixed | Fixed per type | 1 | Variable |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Higher cost and latency**\n",
    "- Multiple LLM calls (orchestrator + workers + synthesis)\n",
    "- More expensive than single-pass approaches\n",
    "- Slower due to sequential orchestrator → workers → synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestrator quality matters**\n",
    "- If the orchestrator misses a key subtask, workers won't analyse it\n",
    "- Garbage in, garbage out\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overkill for simple documents**\n",
    "- A straightforward email doesn't need 10 subtasks\n",
    "- Use routing to send simple docs to simpler classifiers\n",
