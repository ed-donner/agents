DOC001,EMAIL,Email Specialist,PRIVILEGED,85,Sections 118-119 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and Esso v Commissioner of Taxation (1999) (dominant purpose test),"The email is from a general counsel requesting legal advice from a lawyer regarding potential liability implications of a contractual dispute, indicating a request for legal advice. The communication is confidential and relates directly to the legal matter. There are no non-privileged third parties CC'd, and no confidentiality notice appears, but the context supports privilege. Based on the dominant purpose test, the communication's primary purpose is to obtain legal advice, satisfying the criteria for legal professional privilege.",,,,
DOC002,BOARD_MINUTE,Board Minute Specialist,PARTIAL_PRIVILEGE,85,Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 118-119,"The minutes explicitly record that the legal counsel provided a confidential legal briefing on the BuildRight dispute and that the Board discussed the legal advice in confidence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. Such discussions are protected by legal professional privilege under ss 118-119. Conversely, the marketing budget discussion does not involve legal advice and is a standard business matter, thus falling outside privilege. Given the minutes note the legal advice and confidentiality, privilege applies only to the relevant parts.",,,,
DOC003,FILE_NOTE,File Note Specialist,PRIVILEGED,95,Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 118-119,"The file note was created by a lawyer (Michael Wong, Partner) and is marked ""Privileged and Confidential,"" indicating an intention to maintain confidentiality. It records discussions about legal issues, including contractual clauses and legal advice, specifically advising on potential liability and actions to be taken, such as briefing counsel. The primary purpose of the document appears to be to record and facilitate legal advice to the client, satisfying the requirements for legal professional privilege under the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 118-119.",,,,
