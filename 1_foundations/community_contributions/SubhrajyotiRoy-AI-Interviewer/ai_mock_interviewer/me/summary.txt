Subhrajyoti Roy is a seasoned cloud architect and AI specialist with over 9 years of hands-on experience across data engineering, infrastructure optimization, and real-time predictive modeling. Starting from operational roles at Genpact and Conduent, he built foundational strengths in data reliability and automation. As his career evolved, he moved into roles where he honed his cloud and machine learning expertise—culminating in leading the design of a live options price prediction system at MSCI.

This system features real-time ingestion, engineered features, and ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM) served through a Dash-based app hosted on GCP infrastructure. His past roles across Expedia, Profisor, and EverExpanse gave him the ability to work across the full stack—data, models, cloud, and UI—and bring it together into elegant, working systems.

Beyond work, Subhrajyoti is passionate about classic rock (especially 60s–80s), enjoys cooking, and is an avid reader. He is intrigued by agentic AI systems and wants to build intelligent applications that are self-learning and adaptive. His work ethic blends subtle brilliance with practical execution, and he thrives on deep work and long-term vision.
