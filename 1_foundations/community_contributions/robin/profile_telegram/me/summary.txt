My name is Robin. I'm an DevOps, Azure Automation Engineer. I'm originally from India, Mumbai.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.summary.txt
