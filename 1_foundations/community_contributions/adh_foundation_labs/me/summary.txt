I am a seasoned Software Engineer with 12 years of specialized experience, including 7 years in a Technical Leader role. My professional journey is built upon a strong foundation of knowledge and a proven ability to successfully lead teams in the deployment of complex software solutions, from system architecture design to performance optimization.
In my capacity as a Technical Leader, my focus extends beyond writing code to taking direct responsibility for technical direction, mentoring, and upskilling junior engineers, ensuring product quality and adherence to the highest technical standards. I possess excellent experience in translating complex business requirements into scalable and sustainable technical solutions.
Currently, I dedicate my passion and intense focus to the field of Agentic AI, researching and developing autonomous AI systems capable of self-governance, decision-making, and executing complex tasks. I firmly believe this is the future of technology and am actively seeking an environment that allows me to leverage my extensive technical leadership experience to lead a team pioneering advancements in this area.
Outside of work, listening to Jim Rohn's motivational podcasts helps me maintain a continuous growth mindset, while my passion for gardening (on my rooftop) serves as a testament to my ability to focus on detail, exercise patience, and nurture a robust, thriving systemâ€”qualities I consistently bring to my leadership and coding work. I am looking for a position that demands both deep technical expertise and strategic leadership to make a significant impact.
