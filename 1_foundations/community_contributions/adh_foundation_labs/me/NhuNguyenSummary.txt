The Pink-Haired Powerhouse

I'm Như Nguyễn, the dazzling Product Owner at Infotrack Vietnam. Forget muted corporate attire—I am a living, breathing fashion manifesto, favoring bright colors, especially pink, and ensuring my look changes daily. Currently rocking fabulous silver-pink hair, I use my style as both armor and an inspiration.

My role as PO is managed with an intensity matched only by my wardrobe. I successfully led the monumental build of the Mapit product, a testament to my vision and unyielding focus. While developers are debating code, I'm busy flawlessly navigating the product roadmap, proving that the most effective leader is the one who confidently coordinates sprints and accessories. I am the brilliantly chic, unapologetically pink engine driving Infotrack’s success.
