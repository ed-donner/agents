    "Welcome to the **LLM Triathlon Engine**! This notebook is an automated framework designed to rigorously test and benchmark multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) from various providers (like OpenAI, Groq, and local Ollama) in a fair and comprehensive \"triathlon.\"\n",

    "This engine runs in a sequential pipeline. Here is the step-by-step \"bulletin board\" for how it functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stage | Emoji | Description | Key Output |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Stage 1** | ⚙️ | **Setup & Client Init**<br>Dynamically checks all your `os.getenv()` API keys (OpenAI, Groq, etc.) and your local Ollama server. It then builds the list of **available** models to compete. | `competitors` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 2** | 🧠 | **Question Generation**<br>Uses a \"Generator\" LLM to create 3 diverse, high-quality questions. It then uses a \"Consultant\" LLM to rank them and assign the **50, 30, and 20-point** weights. | `questions` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 3** | 🏃‍♂️ | **The Race (Execution)**<br>The main engine. It loops through every *available* model (`competitors`) and asks it *all three* ranked questions (`questions`), dynamically using the correct API client for each. | `all_answers` (dict) |\n",
    "| **Stage 4** | 📊 | **Answer Visualization**<br>Renders all raw answers in a clean, **question-by-question** format. This allows you, the user, to manually inspect and compare the performance on each task. | *Markdown Output* |\n",
    "| **Stage 5** | 🏗️ | **Judge Data Formatting**<br>Combines *all* answers from all models into a single, massive, and meticulously labeled text string (`together_string`) ready to be sent to the Judge. | `together_string` (str) |\n",
    "| **Stage 6** | ⚖️ | **The \"Judge\" Call**<br>Sends the massive prompt (with `together_string`) to a powerful Judge LLM (`gpt-4o`). It requests a **nested JSON** response containing 6 scores per model. | `judge_data_str` (JSON) |\n",
    "| **Stage 7** | 🧮 | **Final Score Calculation**<br>Parses the Judge's JSON. Applies the **two-layer weighting system:**<br> 1. `(Judge Score * 0.6) + (Peer Score * 0.4)`<br> 2. `(Q1 * 0.5) + (Q2 * 0.3) + (Q3 * 0.2)` | `final_rankings_sorted` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 8** | 🥇 | **The Podium (Graphing)**<br>Uses `matplotlib` to plot the final results in a horizontal bar chart. The winning model with the highest total score is highlighted in **gold**. | *Visual Bar Chart* |\n",

    "## 🏆 Stage 7: Final Weighted Score Calculation & Leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final stage that calculates and displays the winner. This code block takes the raw, nested JSON string (`judge_data_str`) retrieved in **Stage 6** and applies your complex, two-layer \"Triathlon\" weighting system to produce the final leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 The Scoring Logic Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "This script performs two levels of mathematical weighting to get the final score:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Calculation | Purpose |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **1. Answer-Level (60/40)** | `(Judge Score * 0.60) + (Peer Score * 0.40)` | First, it calculates the **Adjusted Score** for each *individual answer* to determine its overall quality. |\n",
    "| **2. Question-Level (50/30/20)**| `(Adjusted Score * Question Weight)` | Second, it calculates the answer's **Final Contribution** by multiplying its Adjusted Score by the question's importance (50%, 30%, or 20%). |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏁 Final Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Total Weighted Score** for each model is the **sum of its three Final Contributions**. The script then sorts all models by this final score to generate the definitive leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also includes robust `try...except` blocks to catch:\n",
    "* `json.JSONDecodeError`: If the Judge LLM returned invalid JSON.\n",
    "* `KeyError`: If the returned JSON is missing an expected field (e.g., `judge_score`), meaning the prompt instructions were not followed."
