    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **LLM Triathlon Engine**! This notebook is an automated framework designed to rigorously test and benchmark multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) from various providers (like OpenAI, Groq, and local Ollama) in a fair and comprehensive \"triathlon.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "> ### 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️ The Triathlon Concept\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A simple 100m dash (one question) isn't enough to find the best all-around model. A triathlon tests endurance and skill across three different events with *different weights*. Our engine does the same:\n",
    "> * **Event 1 (Heavy):** A \"heavy-weight\" question (worth **50 points**)\n",
    "> * **Event 2 (Medium):** A \"medium-weight\" question (worth **30 points**)\n",
    "> * **Event 3 (Light):** A \"light-weight\" question (worth **20 points**)\n",

    "## 🚀 How It Works: The 8-Stage Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This engine runs in a sequential pipeline. Here is the step-by-step \"bulletin board\" for how it functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stage | Emoji | Description | Key Output |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Stage 1** | ⚙️ | **Setup & Client Init**<br>Dynamically checks all your `os.getenv()` API keys (OpenAI, Groq, etc.) and your local Ollama server. It then builds the list of **available** models to compete. | `competitors` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 2** | 🧠 | **Question Generation**<br>Uses a \"Generator\" LLM to create 3 diverse, high-quality questions. It then uses a \"Consultant\" LLM to rank them and assign the **50, 30, and 20-point** weights. | `questions` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 3** | 🏃‍♂️ | **The Race (Execution)**<br>The main engine. It loops through every *available* model (`competitors`) and asks it *all three* ranked questions (`questions`), dynamically using the correct API client for each. | `all_answers` (dict) |\n",
    "| **Stage 4** | 📊 | **Answer Visualization**<br>Renders all raw answers in a clean, **question-by-question** format. This allows you, the user, to manually inspect and compare the performance on each task. | *Markdown Output* |\n",
    "| **Stage 5** | 🏗️ | **Judge Data Formatting**<br>Combines *all* answers from all models into a single, massive, and meticulously labeled text string (`together_string`) ready to be sent to the Judge. | `together_string` (str) |\n",
    "| **Stage 6** | ⚖️ | **The \"Judge\" Call**<br>Sends the massive prompt (with `together_string`) to a powerful Judge LLM (`gpt-4o`). It requests a **nested JSON** response containing 6 scores per model. | `judge_data_str` (JSON) |\n",
    "| **Stage 7** | 🧮 | **Final Score Calculation**<br>Parses the Judge's JSON. Applies the **two-layer weighting system:**<br> 1. `(Judge Score * 0.6) + (Peer Score * 0.4)`<br> 2. `(Q1 * 0.5) + (Q2 * 0.3) + (Q3 * 0.2)` | `final_rankings_sorted` (list) |\n",
    "| **Stage 8** | 🥇 | **The Podium (Graphing)**<br>Uses `matplotlib` to plot the final results in a horizontal bar chart. The winning model with the highest total score is highlighted in **gold**. | *Visual Bar Chart* |\n",

       "**1. Predictive Generation & Consumption Analysis:**\n",
       "*   Chronos analyzes hyper-local, real-time weather data, historical energy usage patterns, and the household's or business's digital calendar.\n",
       "*   It predicts energy generation from the solar skin for the next 48 hours with over 95% accuracy.\n",
       "*   It forecasts energy demand based on learned behaviors (e.g., pre-cooling the house before the family returns from work, scheduling industrial machinery during peak solar generation).\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Dynamic Energy Orchestration:**\n",
       "*   This is the core function. Chronos makes millions of micro-decisions per second to optimize energy flow. It automatically decides:\n",
       "    *   **What to Power:** Directing solar energy to high-priority tasks (e.g., charging the EV, running the AC).\n",
       "    *   **When to Store:** Charging the battery bank when generation is high and grid electricity is expensive or carbon-intensive.\n",
       "    *   **When to Sell:** Automatically selling excess energy back to the grid at the most profitable times, turning the home or business into a micro-power plant.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Grid-Supportive \"Swarm\" Intelligence:**\n",
       "*   This is the system's most powerful climate-focused feature. All Helios Cores in a region form a secure, decentralized network—an energy \"swarm.\"\n",
       "*   During periods of high grid stress (e.g., a heatwave), the utility company can send a signal requesting support. Chronos AI can then voluntarily and temporarily draw down a small amount of stored energy from thousands of participating Helios systems to stabilize the grid, preventing brownouts and reducing the need to activate polluting \"peaker\" power plants.\n",

       "*   **Energy Independence & Resilience:** Provides peace of mind during power outages. The system can automatically island the home, running on battery and solar power.\n",
       "*   **Seamless Automation & Convenience:** \"Set it and forget it.\" Consumers don't need to be energy experts. The AI handles everything, and they can monitor and adjust settings via a simple, intuitive smartphone app.\n",

       "\n",
       "Let's break down the ethical implications of intervening versus not intervening:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. The Utilitarian Perspective (Intervene)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Core Principle:** Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, meaning it judges the morality of an action based on its outcome. The goal is to maximize overall good and minimize harm – \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"\n",
       "*   **Application:** From a purely utilitarian standpoint, switching the tracks to save five lives at the cost of one is the morally preferable action. Five deaths are a greater loss than one death. By intervening, you are reducing the total amount of suffering and loss of life.\n",
       "*   **Ethical Implication:** This perspective argues that you have a moral obligation to act in a way that produces the best possible outcome, even if it means actively causing harm to one person to prevent greater harm to many. The individual lives are, in a sense, quantifiable, and saving more is better.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. The Deontological Perspective (Do Not Intervene, or Intervene is Wrong)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Core Principle:** Deontology (duty-based ethics) focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, rather than their consequences. It emphasizes moral duties, rules, and rights.\n",
       "*   **Application:**\n",
       "    *   **Not Intervening:** From a deontological perspective, if you do nothing, the train is the direct cause of the five deaths. You are not actively participating in or causing those deaths. Your inaction, while leading to a tragic outcome, doesn't make you morally culpable for *causing* the deaths in the same way that actively switching the tracks would make you culpable for the death of the one person. There's a distinction between \"killing\" and \"letting die.\"\n",
       "    *   **Intervening is Wrong:** If you switch the tracks, you are actively choosing to sacrifice one innocent life. This could be seen as violating a fundamental moral rule: \"Do not kill.\" You would be using the one person as a means to an end (saving the five), which is often seen as morally impermissible in deontology (e.g., Kant's categorical imperative against treating people merely as means).\n",
       "*   **Ethical Implication:** This perspective argues that you have a duty not to kill an innocent person, regardless of the potential positive consequences of doing so. Actively causing a death, even to save more lives, is an inherently wrong act.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Other Ethical Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Agency and Responsibility:**\n",
       "    *   **Intervening:** You become directly responsible for the death of the one person. This can have significant psychological and moral weight.\n",
       "    *   **Not Intervening:** You are responsible for *allowing* five people to die when you had the power to prevent it. Some argue that inaction when you can prevent harm is also a moral failing.\n",
       "*   **The Value of a Life:** Both perspectives grapple with the inherent value of human life. Utilitarianism, while valuing life, prioritizes the *quantity* of lives saved. Deontology emphasizes the *inviolability* of each individual life. Is one life less valuable than five? Most would agree that each life has intrinsic and equal value, but the dilemma forces a choice where that ideal cannot be fully upheld.\n",
       "*   **Moral Intuition:** Many people find the idea of actively pushing a person to their death (a variation of the trolley problem) more repugnant than pulling a lever, even if the outcome (one death vs. five) is the same. This highlights how our moral intuitions are often sensitive to the *nature* of the action and our direct involvement. In this lever scenario, the \"distance\" might make it feel slightly less personal, but the agency is still there.\n",
       "*   **The \"Clean Hands\" Argument:** Some might argue that by not intervening, you keep your hands \"clean\" from direct responsibility for killing. However, this is often challenged by the idea that you are still complicit by allowing a preventable tragedy.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "There is no easy answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **If you intervene:** You align with a utilitarian viewpoint, prioritizing the greatest good (saving more lives), but you violate a deontological duty not to actively cause harm to an innocent individual. You become directly responsible for a death.\n",
       "*   **If you do not intervene:** You align with a deontological viewpoint, avoiding direct responsibility for killing, but you fail to prevent a greater tragedy, which a utilitarian would see as a moral failing. You are responsible for allowing five deaths when you could have prevented them.\n",

       "| **Rule Utilitarianism** | Follow rules that, if generally adopted, maximize utility. | Might still **support** the switch if a rule like “when a choice can save many at the cost of few, intervene” produces better overall outcomes. | • A rule that permits killing even one innocent person could be abused; the rule‑based approach may reject the act to protect trust in the rule. |\n",
       "| **Deontological Ethics (Kantian)** | Moral duties are derived from rational principles; treat persons as ends in themselves, never merely as means. | **Opposes** the switch. Pulling the lever makes you *actively* cause the death of an innocent person, using them as a means to save others, which violates the categorical imperative. | • Some Kantians argue that *omission* (not pulling) is also a failure to respect the five, but the dominant reading holds that *acts* of killing are impermissible regardless of consequences. |\n",
       "| **Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE)** | An action that has both good and bad effects can be morally permissible if: (1) the act itself is morally neutral or good; (2) the bad effect is not intended (though foreseen); (3) the good effect is proportionally greater; (4) there is no less‑harmful alternative. | The switch is a *means* to an end (the death of the one is a means to save five), so many DDE proponents deem it **impermissible**. | • Some interpret the act as “diverting a dangerous train” (neutral) with the death as an *unintended* side‑effect, which would make it permissible; the debate hinges on how the causal chain is framed. |\n",
       "| **Virtue Ethics** | Focus on the character of the agent (courage, compassion, prudence) rather than on rules or consequences. | A virtuous agent might **choose** to pull the lever out of compassion for the many, but also consider the *justice* owed to the individual. The decision is guided by practical wisdom (phronesis). | • Virtue ethics does not give a crisp “yes/no” answer; it invites a reflective deliberation about what a flourishing moral agent would do. |\n",
       "| **Rights‑Based Ethics** | Individuals possess inviolable rights (e.g., the right not to be killed). | Switching **violates** the one person’s right to life, even if it saves five others. | • Some rights theorists allow *prima facie* rights that can be overridden in extreme emergencies; the hierarchy of rights becomes contested. |\n",
       "| **Legal/Responsibility Perspective** | Distinguishes between *acts* (commission) and *omissions* (non‑action). | Pulling the lever could be seen as **an act of homicide**, incurring criminal liability; doing nothing may be deemed *non‑intervention* (often not punishable). | • Jurisdictions differ on whether omission can be criminal when a *duty to act* exists (e.g., a lifeguard). |\n",

    "| :--- | :--- |\n",

    "| `{question_list_str}` | Provides the full text of all 3 questions, so the Judge has the **context** of what was asked. |\n",
    "| **JSON Schema** (in prompt text) | **The most critical part.** This is a rigid template that *forces* the LLM to return a nested JSON object. |\n",
    "| **Scoring Rules** (in prompt text) | Instructs the Judge to provide the two distinct scores: `judge_score` (objective) and `peer_average_score` (estimated). |\n",
    "| `{together_string}` | This is the **main data payload**. It injects all the formatted answers from all competitors (created in Stage 3/4). |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **🎯 Goal:** To coerce the Judge LLM into acting like a reliable, structured data-parsing-and-scoring API. The success of the final scoring (Stage 6) depends entirely on this prompt returning clean, valid JSON."
