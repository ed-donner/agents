Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

    "\n",
    "RIVERTON — In a 5‑2 vote on Monday night, the Riverton City Council approved a six‑month pilot program to shift most municipal employees to a four‑day, 10‑hour workweek beginning April 1. Supporters said the change will improve staff retention, lower operating costs and make the city more competitive in hiring, while opponents cautioned that compressed schedules could lead to service delays and create childcare challenges for residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the ordinance passed Monday, non‑emergency departments — including permitting, planning, parks and recreation, and most administrative offices — will operate Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with Fridays reserved for maintenance, training and remote administrative work. Police, fire and emergency dispatch will remain on their current schedules; public works will rotate crews so that essential services such as snow removal and sewer responses remain covered seven days a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We heard loud and clear from city staff that burnout and turnover are growing problems,” Mayor Thomas Ellison said after the vote. “This pilot lets us test a modern work model that other municipalities and private employers have reported success with, while building in clear metrics to protect public service levels.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The pilot includes specific performance benchmarks. The city manager’s office will monitor permit processing times, 311 response rates, emergency response times, and employee absenteeism and turnover. If any metric shows a sustained negative trend beyond set thresholds, the council may terminate the program or require departmental adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A city survey conducted in December found 62% of respondents supported a trial, while 26% opposed and 12% were undecided. Nearly three‑quarters of surveyed municipal employees said they would prefer the compressed schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "City labor leaders expressed cautious optimism. “Our members want predictable schedules, better work–life balance and a workplace that attracts skilled people,” said Maria Cruz, president of the Riverton Municipal Employees Association. “We negotiated safeguards so that staffing levels are maintained where they matter most, and so overtime doesn’t simply shift the burden onto a few.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Small business owners and some residents voiced concerns at Monday’s meeting. Jamal Greene, owner of Greene & Co. Hardware, said a Friday closure for city offices could create headaches for contractors and homeowners who rely on in‑person permit pickups and inspections. “We already see projects delayed because of paperwork,” Greene said. “If the city isn’t taking care of permits on Fridays, that could push timelines back and cost customers money.”\n",
    "\n",
    "School officials also urged caution. “Families who need Friday childcare are already stretched thin,” said Dana Lee, principal of Riverton Elementary. “We need to make sure city services don’t inadvertently create new burdens for working parents.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The city’s budget office estimates the pilot could yield modest savings — roughly $150,000 to $250,000 over six months — mostly from reduced building operating costs and lower overtime for administrative staff. Economists who study workplace reforms say financial savings are often secondary to recruitment and retention benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Many employers find a compressed workweek can reduce turnover and increase productivity, but success depends on implementation,” said Dr. Helen Park, a labor economist at Midland State University. “Cities have to watch for unintended consequences: longer shifts can increase fatigue for certain types of work, and service accessibility is a real concern if hours are concentrated.”\n",
    "\n",
    "To address accessibility, the ordinance requires each affected department to publish new hours and create an online portal for routine transactions. The council also approved a $25,000 contingency fund to provide weekend or off‑hour staffing for critical tasks that cannot be delayed.\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "The pilot will be revisited at the council’s regular meeting in October, at which time staff will present data and recommendations. If the program proves successful, the council could vote to make the four‑day schedule permanent or expand it to more employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’re not doing this to save a headline,” Mayor Ellison said. “We’re doing it to find better ways to serve our residents and take care of the people who serve them. This vote gives us a measured, accountable way to find out if this model can do both.”\"\"\"\n",
