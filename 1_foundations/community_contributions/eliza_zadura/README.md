# Community contributions – Eliza Zadura

I am a software developer and course participant.
This folder contains optional notes and experiments based on selected labs in the course.

The materials here:

- are exploratory and non-authoritative
- do not modify or replace course content
- reflect personal observations while working through the labs

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific lab.
