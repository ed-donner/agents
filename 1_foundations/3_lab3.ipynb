Each cat is seen not as a pet but as a conscious being, a participant in the household’s rhythm and meaning.\\n\\n🔹 Summary Thought\\n\\n“If life entrusts you with another soul—human or animal—it becomes part of your own being.\\nYou either accept that unity and live consciously within it, or you retreat from life’s flow and watch it pass without you.”\\n\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\n+905442306126 (Mobile)\\ngonencaydin@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/gonencaydin\\n(LinkedIn)\\ncodevita.solutions (Company)\\nTop Skills\\nGen-AI\\nMCP\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG)\\nLanguages\\nEnglish (Professional Working)\\nCertifications\\nMachine Learning Feature\\nEngineering\\nVMware vSphere: Install, Configure,\\nManage 5.0\\nFundamentals of Machine Learning\\nand Artificial Intelligence\\nDeveloping Machine Learning\\nSolutions\\nITIL\\nGönenç Aydın\\nCloud Eng.
