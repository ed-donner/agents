       "\"Hi! Thanks for reaching out. \\n\\nTo answer your question: no, I don't currently hold any patents. \\n\\nThroughout my career in the nuclear, defense, and aerospace sectors, my focus has been primarily on the design, integration, and validation of high-reliability systems. This includes developing complex control logic for nuclear power generation (like the LABGENE project), creating software for air traffic control at Atech, and managing critical meteorological infrastructure for the Brazilian Air Force. \\n\\nWhile much of the work I do involves creating custom engineering solutions and proprietary software architectures to meet very stringent safety standards, these have typically been part of large-scale institutional projects rather than individual patent filings.\\n\\nIf you are looking for someone with experience in building robust, mission-critical systems or if you have a project in mind that requires that level of precision, I’d be happy to discuss how my background can help!\""
