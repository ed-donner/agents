My name is Keerthi bheemagani. I'm a senior software engineer and full stack developer. I'm originally from India, but I moved to US in 2023.
I love all foods, particularly me food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
