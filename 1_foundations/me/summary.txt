My name is Thiago. I'm an Electronic engineer with 15+ years in high-reliability systems (nuclear, defense, aerospace) transitioning to AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, Cloud Automation and MLOps.
I love my family and my best times is when we are having fun moments together. I also like to travel and discover new kind of cultures.
