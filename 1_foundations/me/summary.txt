I am a cybersecurity researcher and engineer with strong expertise in threat intelligence, natural language processing, and knowledge graph construction. My academic journey spans cybersecurity, software engineering, agentic AI, LLMs, and applied mathematics, where I have developed advanced skills in machine learning, data-driven security analytics, and automated entityâ€“relation extraction from cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports.
I have authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed publications in top conferences and journals (Computers & Security, Knowledge-Based Systems, Springer, SECRYPT, RAID, etc.), focusing on cyber threat intelligence automation, NER/RE models, and dataset integration frameworks aligned with standards like STIX 2.1. These works contribute to advancing AI-driven cybersecurity systems and reproducible research through the release of open-source datasets and frameworks.
Beyond research, I bring hands-on experience in software development (Python, Java, JavaScript/Node.js, React, Django, C/C++), data engineering (Hadoop, Spark), and cloud computing (AWS Certified Developer Associate). I am equally comfortable building production-ready applications, developing AI/ML models, and deploying scalable cybersecurity solutions.
