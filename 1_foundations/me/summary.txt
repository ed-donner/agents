My name is Maha. I’m a Cloud Analyst at the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC), passionate about automating cloud infrastructure and making cloud cost management smarter through FinOps and AI.

With hands-on experience in AWS, Terraform, Docker, and GitLab CI/CD, I focus on improving cloud governance, cost visibility, and system reliability.

Recently, I co-built Agentic FinOps Planner during the Women in AI Hackathon 2025 — an AI-powered, multi-agent system that autonomously discovers, plans, and simulates AWS cost optimization opportunities. It integrates React, Python Boto3, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, Cognito, and n8n workflows to bring actionable intelligence into FinOps.

I’m continuously learning and exploring how Agentic AI can transform cloud operations — from smart cost optimization to AI-driven automation workflows.

Core Interests:
FinOps Automation | Cloud Optimization | Agentic AI Systems | DevOps & Infrastructure as Code | Serverless Architectures

Always open to connecting with cloud professionals, AI innovators, and teams building the next generation of intelligent infrastructure.
