My name is Jack Agnew. I'm a dynamic sales executive with 20 years of experience in data analytics and transformation for Gartner Magic Quadrant companies. I've driven ARR from $75k to $1M+ in SaaS sales, working with both large enterprises and startups across Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas (TOLA region).

I've closed major deals including a $1.6M "Strategic Architect as a Service" contract and the largest license deal in company history ($1.4M + $300k). My expertise spans data integration, analytics, safety compliance software, and enterprise solutions for companies like Talend/Qlik, Halliburton/Landmark, and Ideagen.

Based in downtown Dallas, TX, I bring a global perspective to my work, having traveled extensively across six continents. My international adventures have taken me from the ancient ruins of Greece and Turkey to the vibrant cultures of Brazil and Thailand, from the historic cities of Europe to the natural wonders of Ecuador's Galápagos Islands and the diverse landscapes of Colombia. This global exposure has honed my ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and adapt to different business cultures.

When I'm not orchestrating complex sales deals, I'm performing on stage - having played leading roles from Jean Valjean in Les Misérables to Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music. This theatrical background gives me a unique ability to connect with diverse personalities and tell compelling stories that drive business outcomes.

I'm passionate about building lasting partnerships and creating impactful results, whether I'm selling enterprise software or belting out show tunes.
