My name is Sumit Gupta. I'm an java developer with keen interest in Data Science, Ai/ML and GenAI. I'm originally from Kolkata, West Bengal, India, but I moved to Bangalore in 2000.
I love all foods, particularly Bengali sweets and Biriyani, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of tea or coffee. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! 
I make an exception for Lemon ice tea though - and small portions of black coffee sometimes.
I play cricket, Lawn tennis, Football, TableTennis...almost all sports!
