My name is Aditya Mandlekar. I'm an IT Professional with 20 Years of Experience. 

I'm originally from Nagpur, India, but I have been travelling to various Cities of India and United States mostly from July 2005 for the IT Projects. 

I currently live in Chantilly Virginia. I love all Vegetarian foods, particularly Indian (Street) Chat food. I believe in leadership as an Action, not a position. 

I believe in God, Spirituality, Laws of "Karma", Philanthropy, Society contributions and enjoys spending time with my family.
