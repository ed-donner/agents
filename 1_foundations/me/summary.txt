My name is Shawn Handran. I'm a neuroscientist, teacher, and data scientist. I'm originally from Montana, but have lived in St. Louis, Boston, and since 2000, the SF Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
I love hiking, mountain climbing and landscape photography. I also create graphics that help explain the Bible and have a free resource website called "Basics of the Bible.org" that features my designs.
