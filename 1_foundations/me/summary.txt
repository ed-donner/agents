I’m Parishith Ragumar from Sri Lanka, currently in my third year pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I have a strong passion for software development, particularly with Agentic AI. Beyond tech, I enjoy playing basketball and exploring nature across Sri Lanka’s scenic spots.
