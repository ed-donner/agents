👋 Hello! I’m a passionate Frontend Developer who loves building fast, responsive, and accessible web applications. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I have a strong eye for UI/UX design, and I focus on crafting clean, maintainable code with a seamless user experience.

I'm experienced with state management tools like Redux, data fetching libraries like React Query, and styling with Tailwind CSS. On the backend and tooling side, I work with Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, and Docker. I'm also exploring Python for scripting and backend logic, and building with AI agents to push the boundaries of modern web experiences.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me out exploring the world on two wheels 🚴‍♂️🏍️. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
