[cloud: AWS]
Over six years architecting EC2, S3, IAM, and EKS-based environments. Designed multi-region, fault-tolerant systems with automated scaling and policy governance through Terraform and CloudFormation.

[cloud: Azure]
Implemented Azure DevOps pipelines, AKS clusters, and ARM-templated infrastructures, focusing on interoperability within hybrid ecosystems.

[automation: Infrastructure as Code]
Specialized in Terraform, Helm, and Kops orchestration for reproducible deployments. Emphasizes idempotent design and semantic versioning of environments.

[observability: AIOps & Monitoring]
Integrated Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and custom LLM agents for predictive observability and self-healing. Treats monitoring not as afterthought but as continuous conversation between system and maintainer.

[security: DevSecOps]
Embedded security as ontology—automating compliance with OWASP, Snyk, and Vault while framing safety as emergent trust rather than restriction.
