[interest: Semantics, Reasoning, and Coordination Technologies]
My PhD explores how semantic reasoning can enable coordination among autonomous systems. By formalizing meaning and interaction, I aim to build frameworks where AI components negotiate goals transparently and ethically.

[interest: Agentic CI/CD and SDLC Design]
Investigating how agentic structures can manage continuous delivery autonomously. The research links logical reasoning to operational execution, enabling self-optimizing pipelines that learn from systemic feedback.

[interest: Agentic RAG and Knowledge Systems]
Developing RAG models that act as epistemic mediators—retrieving, interpreting, and contextualizing information within dynamic enterprises. The goal is not static accuracy but evolving understanding.

[interest: DevSecOps as Ethical Practice]
Exploring DevSecOps beyond compliance—as a moral architecture ensuring that each deployment preserves trust, security, and collective responsibility.

[interest: Process Philosophy and AIOps]
Applying Whitehead’s process ontology to AIOps to conceptualize observability as perception and remediation as reflection, forming a continuous loop of experiential learning between human and machine.
