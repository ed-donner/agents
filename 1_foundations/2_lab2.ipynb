Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...\n",

      "You are an independent advisor to the newly elected government of a fictional coastal city‑state of 1.2 million people with an annual public budget of $3 billion (projected to shrink by 0.5% per year) and GDP of $36 billion. Over the next decade the city faces five simultaneous challenges: accelerating sea‑level rise that threatens 20% of developed land within 30 years, a recurring contagious respiratory disease with periodic outbreaks, rising inequality and unemployment, an influx of 150,000 climate migrants over five years, and constrained fiscal capacity. Using plausible assumptions, produce the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) A prioritized 10‑year plan that allocates the annual budget (give dollar amounts and percent of budget each year) across infrastructure (including coastal defenses and managed retreat), public health (prevention, surveillance, surge capacity), social programs (housing, basic income/training), economic stimulus (jobs, business support), and migration support (housing, integration). For each major allocation, justify your choice, quantify expected benefits (e.g., lives saved, jobs created, economic return or avoided losses), list the main risks, and estimate opportunity costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Identify and quantify the three biggest uncertainties that could change your plan, describe how you would monitor them, and specify contingent triggers and how the plan would adapt if each uncertainty materializes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Provide three alternative 10‑year strategies optimized respectively for: (A) maximizing total welfare (utilitarian), (B) maximizing individual freedoms and minimal coercion (libertarian/classical liberal), and (C) prioritizing the worst‑off (egalitarian). For each alternative, show how budget allocations and key actions change and explain the ethical trade‑offs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) List five concrete, high‑impact actions the government must take within the first 90 days and explain why each is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Propose three measurable metrics (with numeric targets) to evaluate progress at year 5 and year 10, and one short‑term indicator to watch in the first 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) State which parts of your recommendation you are least confident about, why (data gaps or hard-to-model dynamics), and what additional data or analysis would most improve confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) In 50 words or fewer, write an executive summary the mayor could read during a tram ride that communicates the core plan and why it will succeed.\n",
      "\n",
