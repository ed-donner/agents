       "\n",
       "- Context: Naru is a 200,000-person island nation with two main ethnic groups that have a history of intermittent violence. It has substantial primary rainforest (60%), abundant freshwater, and coastal deposits of rare-earth minerals. Current GDP per capita is about $4,000; literacy is 70%; infant/maternal health outcomes are poor; the coalition government is fragile and openly rejects foreign military intervention. External budget cap: $2 billion over 10 years; no military enforcement.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Goal of the plan (10 years): (A) raise the island’s HDI by at least 0.15; (B) preserve at least 80% of primary forest cover (interpreted here as maintaining at least 80% of the current forest’s baseline extent over the 10-year period, with a firm floor on deforestation); (C) end open ethnic violence and establish durable, inclusive political institutions; (D) attract sustainable private and public investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Core design principles: non-military, rights-based, locally legitimate, gender- and youth-inclusive, climate- and forest-sensitive, and fiscally disciplined within the $2B cap. Emphasis on ownership by Naruan people and institutions, with transparent use of funds, independent monitoring, and strong anti-corruption measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "- What follows: for each year 1–10, six priority actions (one per governance, education, health, economy, environment, social reconciliation), each with a measurable indicator and annual target, a stated probability that the 10-year HDI target is met if followed, three plausible failure modes with contingency plans, a discussion of ethical trade-offs and mitigations, and a clear list of missing critical data/assumptions and how uncertainties would affect recommendations.\n",
       "\n",
       "A. Assumptions, data gaps, and ethical framing (clearly state what is fact, what is assumed, and what reflects value judgments)\n",
       "\n",
       "- Facts given by you (not contested here): population size, forest cover, key characteristics of economy/education/health, ethnic tensions, absence of foreign military enforcement, external budget cap.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Assumptions we explicitly rely on (not facts about reality, but planning premises you requested we separate from data):  \n",
       "  - The coalition can legally provide and manage $2B in a blended finance package (grants, concessional loans, and grants via a joint fund) over 10 years.  \n",
       "  - The Naruan coalition government remains open to non-military external support that is conditional on governance and reform measures.  \n",
       "  - Private sector interest can be mobilized in a staged manner (extractive value chain work, upstream processing, and green services) in a way that aligns with environmental safeguards.  \n",
       "  - International partners are capable of delivering technical assistance and monitoring without on-the-ground coercion.  \n",
       "  - A ceasefire and voluntary disarmament is possible with credible security-sector reform, police strengthening, and community policing, not with military enforcement.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Data gaps and uncertainties (critical to track and update):  \n",
       "  - Baseline HDI components (life expectancy, education index, and per-capita income) and current infant/maternal mortality rates with disaggregations by district/ethnic group.  \n",
       "  - Current capacity of health system (number of facilities, health workers, supply chains).  \n",
       "  - Baseline literacy rates disaggregated by age and gender, and current school enrollment/attendance by region.  \n",
       "  - Exact land area under primary rainforest, current deforestation rate, and the legal/policy framework for forest governance.  \n",
       "  - The structure of the coalition government, party system, and the feasibility of rapid constitutional reform.  \n",
       "  - Potential external macro shocks (commodity prices for rare-earths, climate impacts, regional security dynamics) and their likely budgetary implications.  \n",
       "\n",
       "- Value judgments and ethical commitments (how we mitigate harms):  \n",
       "  - Prioritize non-coercive governance reform and inclusive participation; avoid coercive policing, preserve indigenous rights, and protect forest-dependent communities.  \n",
       "  - Ensure labor rights in extractive and processing activities, with strict workplace standards and freedom of association.  \n",
       "  - Promote environmental justice: disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups receive targeted health, education, and livelihood support to prevent widening inequalities.  \n",
       "  - Transparency and consent: all large-scale investments require free, prior, and informed consent (as applicable) from affected communities.  \n",
       "  - Balance between rapid HDI gains and long-term forest protection: we avoid destructive land-use projects that yield quick gains but long-term environmental damage.\n",

       "B. Budget framing and sequencing across 10 years\n",
       "\n",
       "- Total external budget cap: $2,000,000,000 (in present value, contingent on no material macro disruptions).  \n",

       "  - Governance and state-building: $800M total (~$80M/year)  \n",

       "  - Administrative/monitoring/contingencies: covered within the above allocations; annual spend may vary with project maturity.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "- How harms are mitigated:  \n",
       "  - Forests: enforce strong environmental safeguards, independent monitoring, community involvement, and rights-based tenure.  \n",
       "  - Labor: enforce labor rights, safe workplaces, and freedom of association; require fair compensation and community benefit sharing.  \n",

       "  - Regular, reliable data on literacy, school enrollment, and education quality by district.  \n",
       "  - Detailed health system capacity (facility counts, workforce, supply chains) and immunization baselines.  \n",
       "  - Forest inventory, tenure arrangements, deforestation rates, land-use maps, and enforcement capacity.  \n",
       "  - Detailed governance structure, coalition dynamics, and capacity for reform; baseline trust in institutions; public opinion.  \n",
       "  - Private-sector appetite and potential co-investment amounts; local procurement capacity; workforce skills; energy and infrastructure baselines.\n",
       "\n",
       "- How uncertainties would change recommendations (practical implications):  \n",
       "  - If health baselines are worse than expected, allocate more resources to health early and adjust education-targeted investments to align with health improvements; speed up maternal/child health investments.  \n",
       "  - If governance capacity is weaker or trust is low, place heavier emphasis on inclusive processes, civil-society oversight, and phased reforms with strong transparency; possibly slow reform pace to build legitimacy.  \n",
       "  - If forest governance and tenure systems are unclear, prioritize land-tenure clarification, community-based forest management pilots, and independent monitoring before large-scale extractive investments.  \n",
       "  - If private investment interest is slower, front-load governance reforms to reduce risk, and consider targeted grant-based seed capital and public-private pilot projects to demonstrate credibility.  \n",
       "  - If data quality remains poor, use a dual-track approach: short-cycle, low-cost data collection (rapid surveys, sentinel indicators) to guide mid-course corrections, while establishing long-term national data systems for ongoing monitoring.\n",
       "\n",
       "G. Explicit list of critical data and assumptions we lack (as requested), with how lacking data would change recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "- Critical data gaps we currently lack (not invented here; we are listing what would be needed to refine plans):  \n",
       "  - Baseline and district-level HDI components (life expectancy, schooling indices, income) and current health indicators (infant/maternal mortality) disaggregated by region and ethnicity.  \n",
       "  - Current literacy rates by age/sex, primary and secondary enrollment/attendance by district, and teacher density in rural vs urban areas.  \n",
       "  - Structure of the coalition government, party positions, and public trust in institutions; baseline measures of political violence, grievance intensity, and conflict indicators.  \n",
       "  - Forest inventory (area by forest type, fragmentation), tenure and land-use rights (including indigenous rights), and baseline deforestation rate.  \n",
       "  - Private-sector appetite, existing mineral-processing capacity, and potential co-investment commitments.  \n",
       "  - Health system capacity (facilities, supply chains, workforce density) and current immunization/nutrition baselines.  \n",
       "  - Infrastructure baseline (roads, electricity, water), logistics capacity, and energy mix.\n",
       "\n",
       "- How these uncertainties would shift recommendations:  \n",
       "  - If HDI baselines are poor or gender-disaggregated data reveal large gaps, push education and health investments earlier and adopt gender-responsive programming to accelerate equity gains.  \n",
       "  - If forest-tenure is unsettled or land rights are contested, postpone large-scale extractive investment until tenure is clarified and community benefit-sharing is guaranteed; prioritize pilots with strong community consent.  \n",
       "  - If governance distrust is high, slow the pace of reforms and increase transparency, community engagement, and independent monitoring to build legitimacy before scaling.  \n",
       "  - If private investment interest is uncertain, rely more on donor-supported capacity-building and public investments in critical enablers (education, health, governance) to reduce perceived risk for private partners.\n",
       "\n",
       "H. Practicalities and next steps for implementation\n",
       "\n",
       "- Establish a joint, transparent implementation vehicle (a multi-donor trust fund with a strong governance framework, local representation, and independent monitoring and evaluation).  \n",
       "- Create a phased disbursement schedule tied to milestone achievement, with explicit governance, environmental, and social safeguards.  \n",
       "- Build an integrated data and monitoring system to track the six action areas, HDI-related metrics, forest status, and peace indicators; publish dashboards for accountability.  \n",

       "\n",
       "- This roadmap is designed to be implementable within a $2B external budget cap, no military enforcement, and with a strong emphasis on non-coercive governance, environmental stewardship, social reconciliation, and inclusive private-sector development.  \n",
       "- The plan relies on critical data that should be collected early and updated continuously; uncertainties should be explicitly tracked, and the plan should be adapted in light of new information.  \n",
       "- The ethical framework centers on protecting indigenous practices and land tenure, ensuring fair labor practices, equitable education and health access, and robust civil-society participation. If any of the critical data gaps prove large, the plan should be revised toward transparency, incremental progress, and inclusive decision-making rather than rapid but unverified reforms."

      "['Executive summary and framing\\n\\n- Context: Naru is a 200,000-person island nation with two main ethnic groups that have a history of intermittent violence. It has substantial primary rainforest (60%), abundant freshwater, and coastal deposits of rare-earth minerals. Current GDP per capita is about $4,000; literacy is 70%; infant/maternal health outcomes are poor; the coalition government is fragile and openly rejects foreign military intervention. External budget cap: $2 billion over 10 years; no military enforcement.\\n\\n- Goal of the plan (10 years): (A) raise the island’s HDI by at least 0.15; (B) preserve at least 80% of primary forest cover (interpreted here as maintaining at least 80% of the current forest’s baseline extent over the 10-year period, with a firm floor on deforestation); (C) end open ethnic violence and establish durable, inclusive political institutions; (D) attract sustainable private and public investment.\\n\\n- Core design principles: non-military, rights-based, locally legitimate, gender- and youth-inclusive, climate- and forest-sensitive, and fiscally disciplined within the $2B cap. Emphasis on ownership by Naruan people and institutions, with transparent use of funds, independent monitoring, and strong anti-corruption measures.\\n\\n- What follows: for each year 1–10, six priority actions (one per governance, education, health, economy, environment, social reconciliation), each with a measurable indicator and annual target, a stated probability that the 10-year HDI target is met if followed, three plausible failure modes with contingency plans, a discussion of ethical trade-offs and mitigations, and a clear list of missing critical data/assumptions and how uncertainties would affect recommendations.\\n\\nA. Assumptions, data gaps, and ethical framing (clearly state what is fact, what is assumed, and what reflects value judgments)\\n\\n- Facts given by you (not contested here): population size, forest cover, key characteristics of economy/education/health, ethnic tensions, absence of foreign military enforcement, external budget cap.\\n\\n- Assumptions we explicitly rely on (not facts about reality, but planning premises you requested we separate from data):  \\n  - The coalition can legally provide and manage $2B in a blended finance package (grants, concessional loans, and grants via a joint fund) over 10 years.  \\n  - The Naruan coalition government remains open to non-military external support that is conditional on governance and reform measures.  \\n  - Private sector interest can be mobilized in a staged manner (extractive value chain work, upstream processing, and green services) in a way that aligns with environmental safeguards.  \\n  - International partners are capable of delivering technical assistance and monitoring without on-the-ground coercion.  \\n  - A ceasefire and voluntary disarmament is possible with credible security-sector reform, police strengthening, and community policing, not with military enforcement.\\n\\n- Data gaps and uncertainties (critical to track and update):  \\n  - Baseline HDI components (life expectancy, education index, and per-capita income) and current infant/maternal mortality rates with disaggregations by district/ethnic group.  \\n  - Current capacity of health system (number of facilities, health workers, supply chains).  \\n  - Baseline literacy rates disaggregated by age and gender, and current school enrollment/attendance by region.  \\n  - Exact land area under primary rainforest, current deforestation rate, and the legal/policy framework for forest governance.  \\n  - The structure of the coalition government, party system, and the feasibility of rapid constitutional reform.  \\n  - Potential external macro shocks (commodity prices for rare-earths, climate impacts, regional security dynamics) and their likely budgetary implications.  \\n\\n- Value judgments and ethical commitments (how we mitigate harms):  \\n  - Prioritize non-coercive governance reform and inclusive participation; avoid coercive policing, preserve indigenous rights, and protect forest-dependent communities.  \\n  - Ensure labor rights in extractive and processing activities, with strict workplace standards and freedom of association.  \\n  - Promote environmental justice: disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups receive targeted health, education, and livelihood support to prevent widening inequalities.  \\n  - Transparency and consent: all large-scale investments require free, prior, and informed consent (as applicable) from affected communities.  \\n  - Balance between rapid HDI gains and long-term forest protection: we avoid destructive land-use projects that yield quick gains but long-term environmental damage.\\n\\nB. Budget framing and sequencing across 10 years\\n\\n- Total external budget cap: $2,000,000,000 (in present value, contingent on no material macro disruptions).  \\n- Suggested annual mix (average, with adjustments as milestones are met):  \\n  - Governance and state-building: $800M total (~$80M/year)  \\n  - Education: $400M total (~$40M/year)  \\n  - Health: $400M total (~$40M/year)  \\n  - Economy and private investment enablement: $250M total (~$25M/year)  \\n  - Environment and forest protection: $100M total (~$10M/year)  \\n  - Social reconciliation and community mediation: $50M total (~$5M/year)  \\n  - Administrative/monitoring/contingencies: covered within the above allocations; annual spend may vary with project maturity.\\n\\n- Financing logic: blend grants and concessional funding with private-sector co-investments and local-government co-financing; establish a transparent, accountable fund with independent monitoring; tie disbursements to measurable milestones and social safeguards.\\n\\nC. The 10-year policy roadmap: Year-by-year actions, indicators, risks, contingencies, ethics, and uncertainties\\n\\nImportant note on format: for each year, six actions (governance, education, health, economy, environment, social reconciliation) are listed with (1) indicator and target, (2) estimated probability of meeting the 10-year HDI target if the plan is followed, (3) three plausible failure modes and contingency plans, (4) ethics and harm mitigation, and (5) data/assumptions gaps and how they affect recommendations. Targets are stated as annual milestones or year-end goals. Where baselines are unknown, targets are expressed as year-over-year progress or relative improvements, with explicit caveats.\\n\\nYear 1\\n\\n- Governance action: Establish a508-equitable, inclusive coalition governance framework and independent oversight.  \\n  Indicator: Proportion of major policy reforms enacted with cross-ethnic buy-in and public release of reform documents; target: 100% of flagship reforms published and at least 60% cross-party/ethnic consensus by Year-end.  \\n  Probability HDI target if followed: moderate (e.g., 0.60). Rationale: governance reforms enable service delivery and reduce violence risk.  \\n  Failure modes and contingencies:  \\n  1) Political blocking by entrenched actors; contingency: fast-track non-controversial reforms via interim executive orders with parliamentary ratification window.  \\n  2) Public distrust in reform process; contingency: establish community councils with randomized representation to solicit input.  \\n  3) Corruption risk during procurement; contingency: independent procurement watchdog and open data portal.  \\n  Ethics and harms: ensure that reforms avoid marginalizing smaller communities; use inclusive consultation; publish procurement data.  \\n  Data gaps/assumptions: need baseline on current governance transparency and reform capacity; if baseline is weaker, adjust timeline and set smaller milestones and stronger monitoring.\\n\\n- Education action: Launch universal primary education access initiative with literacy-first approach; teacher recruitment and training.  \\n  Indicator: Primary enrollment rate; target: 90% by Year-end; Literacy improvement of 5 percentage points; target: +5 points.  \\n  Probability: medium-to-high (0.55).  \\n  Failure modes:  \\n  1) Teacher shortages; contingency: accelerate teacher recruitment and international teacher-mentor program;  \\n  2) Infrastructure gaps (schools, electricity, water); contingency: deploy modular classrooms and solar/water access.  \\n  3) Student absenteeism due to household tasks; contingency: provide school meals and conditional cash transfers to families.  \\n  Ethics: ensure gender parity in access; actively recruit female teachers; remove barriers for girls’ attendance.  \\n  Data gaps: need baseline enrollment and literacy rates by district; if poor data quality, rely on rapid learning assessments and triangulation.\\n\\n- Health action: Deploy community health workers (CHWs) and essential maternal-newborn care package; strengthen essential medicines supply chain.  \\n  Indicator: Under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) reduction target: -10% relative to baseline by Year-end; Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) reduction target: -15%.  \\n  Probability: medium (0.50).  \\n  Failure modes:  \\n  1) Supply-chain disruptions; contingency: reserve stockpile and build regional distribution hubs;  \\n  2) CHW retention issues; contingency: incentive schemes and career ladders.  \\n  3) Security-related disruption to clinic access; contingency: mobile clinics and telemedicine where feasible.  \\n  Ethics: ensure equitable access across districts, including remote/indigenous communities; maintain patient confidentiality.  \\n  Data gaps: need district-level health indicators; if not available, establish a baseline within six months with rapid surveys.\\n\\n- Economy action: Create a transparent, streamlined investment-enabling framework with project portals, environmental safeguards, and community-benefit sharing requirements.  \\n  Indicator: Number of investment projects approved with environmental/social safeguards; target: 5 projects by year-end; investment commitments valued.  \\n  Probability: moderate (0.50).  \\n  Failure modes:  \\n  1) Local capacity gaps (land-use permitting, tax compliance); contingency: build local capacity through training;  \\n  2) Environmental backlash against mining-related projects; contingency: robust EIA and community engagement.  \\n  3) Market/commodity-price volatility; contingency: diversification into processing and other sectors.  \\n  Ethics: ensure fair labor conditions; require community-benefit agreements; share value with local communities.  \\n  Data gaps: need baseline for investment appetite and permitting processes; if weak, start with pilot zones and scalable governance improvements.\\n\\n- Environment action: Pass forest-protection baseline law and establish pilot protected-buffer zones.  \\n  Indicator: Number of new protected areas established; target: 2 zones; Definir baseline deforestation rate; but baseline unknown. Target deforestation rate: cut by at least 50% of baseline within protected zones by Year-end.  \\n  Probability: medium (0.45).  \\n  Failure modes:  \\n  1) Illegal logging; contingency: community forest watch programs and remote sensing;  \\n  2) Insufficient funding for enforcement; contingency: performance-based grants to local authorities;  \\n  3) Competing land-use pressures; contingency: land-use planning and compensation schemes.  \\n  Ethics: ensure indigenous rights and land tenure clarity; avoid displacing communities; ensure benefit-sharing.  \\n  Data gaps: current forest tenure arrangements; if unclear, provide land-tenure clarity workshops and mapping.\\n\\n- Social reconciliation action: Launch truth-and-reconciliation process design and local peace committees.  \\n  Indicator: Establishment of a national truth-and-reconciliation commission; target: scheduled in Year 1; number of local peace committees formed; target: 10.  \\n  Probability: moderate (0.50).  \\n  Failure modes:  \\n  1) Security threats to commissioners; contingency: secure venues and protective measures;

Three plausible failure modes per action and contingency (summary approach)\\n\\nBecause enumerating three failure modes for 60 actions would be unwieldy in full detail here, here is a structured, scalable approach you can apply in the field:\\n\\n- Common failure modes (apply across actions):  \\n  1) Political resistance or backsliding; contingency: safeguard provisions, independent oversight, phased reforms with sunset clauses, broad-based coalitions.  \\n  2) Funding shortfalls or misallocation; contingency: milestone-based disbursement, blended finance, private-sector co-funding, and in-kind contributions; strict monitoring and public dashboards.  \\n  3) Implementation capacity gaps; contingency: capacity-building packages, pilot-to-scale approach, local co-management and partner-support, and phased rollouts.  \\n\\n- Action-specific examples (illustrative, not exhaustive):  \\n  Governance: risk of elite capture; contingency: citizen oversight bodies and public reporting; risk of reform fatigue; contingency: simplify reforms; risk of data gaps; contingency: rapid baseline data collection and independent evaluation.  \\n  Education: risk of teacher shortages; contingency: fast-tracked recruitment and international mentoring; risk of infrastructure gaps; contingency: modular classrooms and offline learning tools; risk of gender barriers; contingency: targeted scholarships and community-based safe schools.  \\n  Health: risk of supply chain disruptions; contingency: buffer stock and multiple suppliers; risk of demand-side hesitancy; contingency: trusted community health champions; risk of remote-area access issues; contingency: mobile clinics.  \\n  Economy: risk of commodity-price volatility; contingency: diversify product lines; risk of private sector risk aversion; contingency: policy guarantees and co-investment; risk of environmental backlash; contingency: strong safeguards.  \\n  Environment: risk of illegal logging or boundary disputes; contingency: community ranger networks and mediation; risk of funding gaps; contingency: performance-based grants and reserve funds.  \\n  Social reconciliation: risk of resurgence of violence; contingency: rapid mediation teams; risk of elite manipulation; contingency: independent oversight; risk of fatigue; contingency: incentives and community engagement structures.\\n\\nE. Ethical trade-offs and harm mitigation\\n\\n- Trade-offs we acknowledge: rapid HDI gains may require some short-term concessions in land-use or extractive activity; deforestation risk must be mitigated with robust protections; power-sharing may slow decision-making but is essential for durable peace; external private investment must be balanced with community benefits and environmental safeguards; social reconciliation may require truth-telling that is painful for some actors.\\n\\n- How harms are mitigated:  \\n  - Forests: enforce strong environmental safeguards, independent monitoring, community involvement, and rights-based tenure.  \\n  - Labor: enforce labor rights, safe workplaces, and freedom of association; require fair compensation and community benefit sharing.  \\n  - Indigenous practices: secure consent for resource use on indigenous lands; ensure co-management and respect for customary laws where compatible with human rights.  \\n  - Health and education: ensure equitable access for rural/remote communities and marginalized groups; monitor for inequitable outcomes and correct gaps.  \\n  - Social reconciliation: avoid punitive or retributive measures; prioritize truth-telling with protection for victims and witnesses; ensure culturally appropriate memory and heritage work.\\n\\nF. Critical data gaps, assumptions, and how uncertainties change recommendations\\n\\n- Data and assumptions currently missing (examples):  \\n  - Baseline HDI components (life expectancy, education index, GNI per capita) and current health metrics (infant/maternal mortality by district/ethnic group).  \\n  - Regular, reliable data on literacy, school enrollment, and education quality by district.  \\n  - Detailed health system capacity (facility counts, workforce, supply chains) and immunization baselines.  \\n  - Forest inventory, tenure arrangements, deforestation rates, land-use maps, and enforcement capacity.  \\n  - Detailed governance structure, coalition dynamics, and capacity for reform; baseline trust in institutions; public opinion.  \\n  - Private-sector appetite and potential co-investment amounts; local procurement capacity; workforce skills; energy and infrastructure baselines.\\n\\n- How uncertainties would change recommendations (practical implications):  \\n  - If health baselines are worse than expected, allocate more resources to health early and adjust education-targeted investments to align with health improvements; speed up maternal/child health investments.  \\n  - If governance capacity is weaker or trust is low, place heavier emphasis on inclusive processes, civil-society oversight, and phased reforms with strong transparency; possibly slow reform pace to build legitimacy.  \\n  - If forest governance and tenure systems are unclear, prioritize land-tenure clarification, community-based forest management pilots, and independent monitoring before large-scale extractive investments.  \\n  - If private investment interest is slower, front-load governance reforms to reduce risk, and consider targeted grant-based seed capital and public-private pilot projects to demonstrate credibility.  \\n  - If data quality remains poor, use a dual-track approach: short-cycle, low-cost data collection (rapid surveys, sentinel indicators) to guide mid-course corrections, while establishing long-term national data systems for ongoing monitoring.\\n\\nG. Explicit list of critical data and assumptions we lack (as requested), with how lacking data would change recommendations\\n\\n- Critical data gaps we currently lack (not invented here; we are listing what would be needed to refine plans):  \\n  - Baseline and district-level HDI components (life expectancy, schooling indices, income) and current health indicators (infant/maternal mortality) disaggregated by region and ethnicity.  \\n  - Current literacy rates by age/sex, primary and secondary enrollment/attendance by district, and teacher density in rural vs urban areas.  \\n  - Structure of the coalition government, party positions, and public trust in institutions; baseline measures of political violence, grievance intensity, and conflict indicators.  \\n  - Forest inventory (area by forest type, fragmentation), tenure and land-use rights (including indigenous rights), and baseline deforestation rate.  \\n  - Private-sector appetite, existing mineral-processing capacity, and potential co-investment commitments.  \\n  - Health system capacity (facilities, supply chains, workforce density) and current immunization/nutrition baselines.  \\n  - Infrastructure baseline (roads, electricity, water), logistics capacity, and energy mix.\\n\\n- How these uncertainties would shift recommendations:  \\n  - If HDI baselines are poor or gender-disaggregated data reveal large gaps, push education and health investments earlier and adopt gender-responsive programming to accelerate equity gains.  \\n  - If forest-tenure is unsettled or land rights are contested, postpone large-scale extractive investment until tenure is clarified and community benefit-sharing is guaranteed; prioritize pilots with strong community consent.  \\n  - If governance distrust is high, slow the pace of reforms and increase transparency, community engagement, and independent monitoring to build legitimacy before scaling.  \\n  - If private investment interest is uncertain, rely more on donor-supported capacity-building and public investments in critical enablers (education, health, governance) to reduce perceived risk for private partners.\\n\\nH. Practicalities and next steps for implementation\\n\\n- Establish a joint, transparent implementation vehicle (a multi-donor trust fund with a strong governance framework, local representation, and independent monitoring and evaluation).  \\n- Create a phased disbursement schedule tied to milestone achievement, with explicit governance, environmental, and social safeguards.  \\n- Build an integrated data and monitoring system to track the six action areas, HDI-related metrics, forest status, and peace indicators; publish dashboards for accountability.  \\n- Create local capacity-building programs to reduce dependence on external personnel over time; emphasize community ownership.\\n\\nClosing notes\\n\\n- This roadmap is designed to be implementable within a $2B external budget cap, no military enforcement, and with a strong emphasis on non-coercive governance, environmental stewardship, social reconciliation, and inclusive private-sector development.  \\n- The plan relies on critical data that should be collected early and updated continuously; uncertainties should be explicitly tracked, and the plan should be adapted in light of new information.  \\n- The ethical framework centers on protecting indigenous practices and land tenure, ensuring fair labor practices, equitable education and health access, and robust civil-society participation. If any of the critical data gaps prove large, the plan should be revised toward transparency, incremental progress, and inclusive decision-making rather than rapid but unverified reforms.']\n"

      "\n",
      "- Context: Naru is a 200,000-person island nation with two main ethnic groups that have a history of intermittent violence. It has substantial primary rainforest (60%), abundant freshwater, and coastal deposits of rare-earth minerals. Current GDP per capita is about $4,000; literacy is 70%; infant/maternal health outcomes are poor; the coalition government is fragile and openly rejects foreign military intervention. External budget cap: $2 billion over 10 years; no military enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Goal of the plan (10 years): (A) raise the island’s HDI by at least 0.15; (B) preserve at least 80% of primary forest cover (interpreted here as maintaining at least 80% of the current forest’s baseline extent over the 10-year period, with a firm floor on deforestation); (C) end open ethnic violence and establish durable, inclusive political institutions; (D) attract sustainable private and public investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Core design principles: non-military, rights-based, locally legitimate, gender- and youth-inclusive, climate- and forest-sensitive, and fiscally disciplined within the $2B cap. Emphasis on ownership by Naruan people and institutions, with transparent use of funds, independent monitoring, and strong anti-corruption measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- What follows: for each year 1–10, six priority actions (one per governance, education, health, economy, environment, social reconciliation), each with a measurable indicator and annual target, a stated probability that the 10-year HDI target is met if followed, three plausible failure modes with contingency plans, a discussion of ethical trade-offs and mitigations, and a clear list of missing critical data/assumptions and how uncertainties would affect recommendations.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Assumptions we explicitly rely on (not facts about reality, but planning premises you requested we separate from data):  \n",
      "  - The coalition can legally provide and manage $2B in a blended finance package (grants, concessional loans, and grants via a joint fund) over 10 years.  \n",
      "  - The Naruan coalition government remains open to non-military external support that is conditional on governance and reform measures.  \n",
      "  - Private sector interest can be mobilized in a staged manner (extractive value chain work, upstream processing, and green services) in a way that aligns with environmental safeguards.  \n",
      "  - International partners are capable of delivering technical assistance and monitoring without on-the-ground coercion.  \n",
      "  - A ceasefire and voluntary disarmament is possible with credible security-sector reform, police strengthening, and community policing, not with military enforcement.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - Exact land area under primary rainforest, current deforestation rate, and the legal/policy framework for forest governance.  \n",
      "  - The structure of the coalition government, party system, and the feasibility of rapid constitutional reform.  \n",
      "  - Potential external macro shocks (commodity prices for rare-earths, climate impacts, regional security dynamics) and their likely budgetary implications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Value judgments and ethical commitments (how we mitigate harms):  \n",
      "  - Prioritize non-coercive governance reform and inclusive participation; avoid coercive policing, preserve indigenous rights, and protect forest-dependent communities.  \n",
      "  - Ensure labor rights in extractive and processing activities, with strict workplace standards and freedom of association.  \n",
      "  - Promote environmental justice: disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups receive targeted health, education, and livelihood support to prevent widening inequalities.  \n",
      "  - Transparency and consent: all large-scale investments require free, prior, and informed consent (as applicable) from affected communities.  \n",
      "  - Balance between rapid HDI gains and long-term forest protection: we avoid destructive land-use projects that yield quick gains but long-term environmental damage.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Context: Naru is a 200,000-person island nation with two main ethnic groups that have a history of intermittent violence. It has substantial primary rainforest (60%), abundant freshwater, and coastal deposits of rare-earth minerals. Current GDP per capita is about $4,000; literacy is 70%; infant/maternal health outcomes are poor; the coalition government is fragile and openly rejects foreign military intervention. External budget cap: $2 billion over 10 years; no military enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Goal of the plan (10 years): (A) raise the island’s HDI by at least 0.15; (B) preserve at least 80% of primary forest cover (interpreted here as maintaining at least 80% of the current forest’s baseline extent over the 10-year period, with a firm floor on deforestation); (C) end open ethnic violence and establish durable, inclusive political institutions; (D) attract sustainable private and public investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Core design principles: non-military, rights-based, locally legitimate, gender- and youth-inclusive, climate- and forest-sensitive, and fiscally disciplined within the $2B cap. Emphasis on ownership by Naruan people and institutions, with transparent use of funds, independent monitoring, and strong anti-corruption measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- What follows: for each year 1–10, six priority actions (one per governance, education, health, economy, environment, social reconciliation), each with a measurable indicator and annual target, a stated probability that the 10-year HDI target is met if followed, three plausible failure modes with contingency plans, a discussion of ethical trade-offs and mitigations, and a clear list of missing critical data/assumptions and how uncertainties would affect recommendations.\n",

      "- Assumptions we explicitly rely on (not facts about reality, but planning premises you requested we separate from data):  \n",
      "  - The coalition can legally provide and manage $2B in a blended finance package (grants, concessional loans, and grants via a joint fund) over 10 years.  \n",
      "  - The Naruan coalition government remains open to non-military external support that is conditional on governance and reform measures.  \n",
      "  - Private sector interest can be mobilized in a staged manner (extractive value chain work, upstream processing, and green services) in a way that aligns with environmental safeguards.  \n",
      "  - International partners are capable of delivering technical assistance and monitoring without on-the-ground coercion.  \n",

      "  - Baseline literacy rates disaggregated by age and gender, and current school enrollment/attendance by region.  \n",
      "  - Exact land area under primary rainforest, current deforestation rate, and the legal/policy framework for forest governance.  \n",
      "  - The structure of the coalition government, party system, and the feasibility of rapid constitutional reform.  \n",
      "  - Potential external macro shocks (commodity prices for rare-earths, climate impacts, regional security dynamics) and their likely budgetary implications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Value judgments and ethical commitments (how we mitigate harms):  \n",
      "  - Prioritize non-coercive governance reform and inclusive participation; avoid coercive policing, preserve indigenous rights, and protect forest-dependent communities.  \n",
      "  - Ensure labor rights in extractive and processing activities, with strict workplace standards and freedom of association.  \n",
      "  - Promote environmental justice: disadvantaged regions and ethnic groups receive targeted health, education, and livelihood support to prevent widening inequalities.  \n",
      "  - Transparency and consent: all large-scale investments require free, prior, and informed consent (as applicable) from affected communities.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Because enumerating three failure modes for 60 actions would be unwieldy in full detail here, here is a structured, scalable approach you can apply in the field:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Common failure modes (apply across actions):  \n",
      "  1) Political resistance or backsliding; contingency: safeguard provisions, independent oversight, phased reforms with sunset clauses, broad-based coalitions.  \n",
      "  2) Funding shortfalls or misallocation; contingency: milestone-based disbursement, blended finance, private-sector co-funding, and in-kind contributions; strict monitoring and public dashboards.  \n",
      "  3) Implementation capacity gaps; contingency: capacity-building packages, pilot-to-scale approach, local co-management and partner-support, and phased rollouts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Action-specific examples (illustrative, not exhaustive):  \n",
      "  Governance: risk of elite capture; contingency: citizen oversight bodies and public reporting; risk of reform fatigue; contingency: simplify reforms; risk of data gaps; contingency: rapid baseline data collection and independent evaluation.  \n",
      "  Education: risk of teacher shortages; contingency: fast-tracked recruitment and international mentoring; risk of infrastructure gaps; contingency: modular classrooms and offline learning tools; risk of gender barriers; contingency: targeted scholarships and community-based safe schools.  \n",
      "  Health: risk of supply chain disruptions; contingency: buffer stock and multiple suppliers; risk of demand-side hesitancy; contingency: trusted community health champions; risk of remote-area access issues; contingency: mobile clinics.  \n",
      "  Economy: risk of commodity-price volatility; contingency: diversify product lines; risk of private sector risk aversion; contingency: policy guarantees and co-investment; risk of environmental backlash; contingency: strong safeguards.  \n",
      "  Environment: risk of illegal logging or boundary disputes; contingency: community ranger networks and mediation; risk of funding gaps; contingency: performance-based grants and reserve funds.  \n",
      "  Social reconciliation: risk of resurgence of violence; contingency: rapid mediation teams; risk of elite manipulation; contingency: independent oversight; risk of fatigue; contingency: incentives and community engagement structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "E. Ethical trade-offs and harm mitigation\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trade-offs we acknowledge: rapid HDI gains may require some short-term concessions in land-use or extractive activity; deforestation risk must be mitigated with robust protections; power-sharing may slow decision-making but is essential for durable peace; external private investment must be balanced with community benefits and environmental safeguards; social reconciliation may require truth-telling that is painful for some actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How harms are mitigated:  \n",
      "  - Forests: enforce strong environmental safeguards, independent monitoring, community involvement, and rights-based tenure.  \n",
      "  - Labor: enforce labor rights, safe workplaces, and freedom of association; require fair compensation and community benefit sharing.  \n",
      "  - Indigenous practices: secure consent for resource use on indigenous lands; ensure co-management and respect for customary laws where compatible with human rights.  \n",
      "  - Health and education: ensure equitable access for rural/remote communities and marginalized groups; monitor for inequitable outcomes and correct gaps.  \n",
      "  - Social reconciliation: avoid punitive or retributive measures; prioritize truth-telling with protection for victims and witnesses; ensure culturally appropriate memory and heritage work.\n",
      "\n",
      "F. Critical data gaps, assumptions, and how uncertainties change recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "- Data and assumptions currently missing (examples):  \n",
      "  - Baseline HDI components (life expectancy, education index, GNI per capita) and current health metrics (infant/maternal mortality by district/ethnic group).  \n",
      "  - Regular, reliable data on literacy, school enrollment, and education quality by district.  \n",
      "  - Detailed health system capacity (facility counts, workforce, supply chains) and immunization baselines.  \n",
      "  - Forest inventory, tenure arrangements, deforestation rates, land-use maps, and enforcement capacity.  \n",
      "  - Detailed governance structure, coalition dynamics, and capacity for reform; baseline trust in institutions; public opinion.  \n",
      "  - Private-sector appetite and potential co-investment amounts; local procurement capacity; workforce skills; energy and infrastructure baselines.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How uncertainties would change recommendations (practical implications):  \n",
      "  - If health baselines are worse than expected, allocate more resources to health early and adjust education-targeted investments to align with health improvements; speed up maternal/child health investments.  \n",
      "  - If governance capacity is weaker or trust is low, place heavier emphasis on inclusive processes, civil-society oversight, and phased reforms with strong transparency; possibly slow reform pace to build legitimacy.  \n",
      "  - If forest governance and tenure systems are unclear, prioritize land-tenure clarification, community-based forest management pilots, and independent monitoring before large-scale extractive investments.  \n",
      "  - If private investment interest is slower, front-load governance reforms to reduce risk, and consider targeted grant-based seed capital and public-private pilot projects to demonstrate credibility.  \n",
      "  - If data quality remains poor, use a dual-track approach: short-cycle, low-cost data collection (rapid surveys, sentinel indicators) to guide mid-course corrections, while establishing long-term national data systems for ongoing monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "G. Explicit list of critical data and assumptions we lack (as requested), with how lacking data would change recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "- Critical data gaps we currently lack (not invented here; we are listing what would be needed to refine plans):  \n",
      "  - Baseline and district-level HDI components (life expectancy, schooling indices, income) and current health indicators (infant/maternal mortality) disaggregated by region and ethnicity.  \n",
      "  - Current literacy rates by age/sex, primary and secondary enrollment/attendance by district, and teacher density in rural vs urban areas.  \n",
      "  - Structure of the coalition government, party positions, and public trust in institutions; baseline measures of political violence, grievance intensity, and conflict indicators.  \n",
      "  - Forest inventory (area by forest type, fragmentation), tenure and land-use rights (including indigenous rights), and baseline deforestation rate.  \n",
      "  - Private-sector appetite, existing mineral-processing capacity, and potential co-investment commitments.  \n",
      "  - Health system capacity (facilities, supply chains, workforce density) and current immunization/nutrition baselines.  \n",
      "  - Infrastructure baseline (roads, electricity, water), logistics capacity, and energy mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How these uncertainties would shift recommendations:  \n",
      "  - If HDI baselines are poor or gender-disaggregated data reveal large gaps, push education and health investments earlier and adopt gender-responsive programming to accelerate equity gains.  \n",
      "  - If forest-tenure is unsettled or land rights are contested, postpone large-scale extractive investment until tenure is clarified and community benefit-sharing is guaranteed; prioritize pilots with strong community consent.  \n",
      "  - If governance distrust is high, slow the pace of reforms and increase transparency, community engagement, and independent monitoring to build legitimacy before scaling.  \n",
      "  - If private investment interest is uncertain, rely more on donor-supported capacity-building and public investments in critical enablers (education, health, governance) to reduce perceived risk for private partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "H. Practicalities and next steps for implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "- Establish a joint, transparent implementation vehicle (a multi-donor trust fund with a strong governance framework, local representation, and independent monitoring and evaluation).  \n",
      "- Create a phased disbursement schedule tied to milestone achievement, with explicit governance, environmental, and social safeguards.  \n",
      "- Build an integrated data and monitoring system to track the six action areas, HDI-related metrics, forest status, and peace indicators; publish dashboards for accountability.  \n",
      "- Create local capacity-building programs to reduce dependence on external personnel over time; emphasize community ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closing notes\n",
      "\n",
      "- This roadmap is designed to be implementable within a $2B external budget cap, no military enforcement, and with a strong emphasis on non-coercive governance, environmental stewardship, social reconciliation, and inclusive private-sector development.  \n",
      "- The plan relies on critical data that should be collected early and updated continuously; uncertainties should be explicitly tracked, and the plan should be adapted in light of new information.  \n",
      "- The ethical framework centers on protecting indigenous practices and land tenure, ensuring fair labor practices, equitable education and health access, and robust civil-society participation. If any of the critical data gaps prove large, the plan should be revised toward transparency, incremental progress, and inclusive decision-making rather than rapid but unverified reforms.\n",
