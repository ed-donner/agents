      "   Mexican laws around data protection (e.g., the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties - LFPDPPP) must be adhered to, especially when dealing with personal data from learners or church planters.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Digital Literacy:**  \n",
      "   Trainees and local church planters might have varying levels of comfort and familiarity with technology, requiring user-friendly interfaces and training on how to use AI tools effectively.\n",
