DevSecOps Engineer | AWS | Kubernetes | Terraform | CI/CD | Cloud Automation | FinOps | Generative AI | Agentic AI | Prompt Engineering

With over a decade of experience across the SDLC, I design and implement secure, scalable AWS multi-account architectures using Control Tower and AWS Organizations. My focus is on automating cloud infrastructure, optimizing costs, and enabling teams to deliver software faster and more securely.

Passionate about the future of AI, I explore Generative AI and Amazon Bedrock, building agentic AI workflows that transform ideas into scalable solutions.

Outside of tech, I’m a foodie — I love French steak (medium-well) with a good red wine, Caribbean fusion dishes, and Jollof rice with grilled sea bass and plantain. During football season, you’ll usually find me twice a week at the pitch — weekday training and weekend league matches — cheering on my boys. In the summer, I switch gears to barbecues and family time outdoors.
