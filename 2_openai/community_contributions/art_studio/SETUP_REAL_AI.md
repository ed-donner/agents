# Setting Up Real AI Integration

## Current Status
Right now, the Art Studio is using **simulated AI responses** - it's not connected to real AI models. The responses look intelligent but are just sophisticated templates.

## To Get Real AI Responses

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
- Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Sign up/Login and get your API key
- You'll need credits in your account

### 2. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
```

### 3. Install OpenAI Package
```bash
pip install openai
```

### 4. Update the Code
The current `_generate_ai_concept()` methods need to be replaced with real OpenAI API calls.

## What Real AI Would Look Like

Instead of this simulated response:
```
ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Creative Concept:
ðŸŽ¨ **Artistic Vision**: Based on your prompt "crypto art"...
```

You'd get actual GPT-4 generated content like:
```
ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Creative Concept:

ðŸŽ¨ **Artistic Vision**: Based on your prompt "crypto art", I've analyzed the creative requirements and generated a comprehensive concept.

ðŸŒŸ **Detected Themes**: blockchain technology, digital innovation, financial freedom

ðŸŽ¯ **Creative Direction**: 
- Primary Style: Futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic with blockchain symbolism
- Color Palette: Electric blues, neon greens, and metallic silvers representing digital currency
- Composition: Dynamic geometric patterns inspired by blockchain networks
- Technical Approach: High-contrast digital art with glowing elements and sharp edges

ðŸ’¡ **AI Insights**: This concept merges the rebellious energy of cryptocurrency with the precision of blockchain technology, creating a visual metaphor for digital transformation.

ðŸš€ **Next Steps**: This concept is ready for visual development by our Sketch Artist agent.
```

## Next Steps to Implement Real AI

1. **Replace simulation methods** with real OpenAI API calls
2. **Use the agents' actual execution** instead of our custom methods
3. **Enable real delegation** between agents using the SDK
4. **Add image generation** with DALL-E 3

## Current Limitation
The OpenAI Agents SDK is set up but we're not using its execution engine yet. We need to:
- Configure the agents with real model parameters
- Use `agents.run()` or similar execution methods
- Enable the built-in handoff capabilities

Would you like me to implement the real AI integration next?
