If you're able to rate the course on Udemy, I'd be seriously grateful: it's the most important way that Udemy decides whether to show the course to others and it makes a massive difference.<br/><br/>And another reminder to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/\">connect with me on LinkedIn</a> if you wish! If you wanted to post about your progress on the course, please tag me and I'll weigh in to increase your exposure.\n",
