## Summary: Achieving Millisecond Latency in Databricks Apps with Lakebase

**Topic:** Performance comparison of Lakebase and SQL Warehouse for low-latency operations in Databricks Apps.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Databricks Apps:** Feature released in the second half of 2024, enables users to create dashboards and data apps directly on Databricks.
