    "1. Call `devsecops_email_writer` for a DevSecOps-focused email\n",
    "2. Call `rag_email_writer` for a RAG/Knowledge-focused email  \n",
    "3. Call `ai_assistant_email_writer` for an AI Assistant-focused email\n",

    "- Select the SINGLE BEST email that would most likely get a positive response \n",
