## 1. Introduction
New Zealand's dairy industry stands as one of the cornerstones of its economy, underpinning national exports and providing significant employment. Characterized by strategic approaches to global trade and robust domestic production, the dairy export sector is vital for New Zealand's financial health and global standing.

## 2. Economic Impact of Dairy Exports on New Zealand  
### 2.1 Contribution to GDP  
In the year ending March 2023, the dairy sector contributed approximately NZ$11.3 billion to New Zealand's GDP, accounting for about 3.2% of the nation's total economic output. Dairy exports alone contributed roughly NZ$26.2 billion in 2023, representing a 7.1% increase from the previous year, thus solidifying its position as a leading sector of New Zealand's export economy.

### 2.2 Employment in the Dairy Sector  
The dairy industry employs approximately 54,787 individuals, with a significant proportion (approximately 70%) engaged in farming and processing. This sector is crucial not only because of its workforce size but also due to the economic stability and wages it provides, which totaled NZ$3.6 billion in 2023.

### 2.3 Regional Economic Significance  
Dairy farming plays a prominent role in local economies, particularly in regions like Waimate and South Taranaki, where the industry accounts for more than 20% of job opportunities. The widespread presence of dairy farms contributes to stabilizing regional economies, particularly in rural areas heavily dependent on agriculture.

## 3. Overview of Dairy Exports  
### 3.1 Export Categories and Volume  
New Zealand's dairy export portfolio includes several key products:
- Whole Milk Powder (WMP): 37% 
- Cheese: 12% 
- Skim Milk Powder (SMP): 10% 
- Butter: 9% 

In January 2023, dairy export volumes saw a 14% increase year-on-year, totaling 341,765 metric tonnes, signaling robust growth driven primarily by WMP and SMP, which grew by 7% and 70%, respectively.

### 3.2 Key Markets  
China is New Zealand's largest market for dairy exports, accounting for about 32-35% of all exports. The United States has recently surpassed Australia, achieving a record NZ$5.4 billion in dairy exports, making it New Zealand's second-largest export destination.

## 4. Regulatory Framework Governing Dairy Exports  
### 4.1 Key Legislation  
New Zealandâ€™s dairy export regulations are structured under various pieces of legislation:
- Animal Products Act 1999  
- Food Act 2014  
- Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code  

To export dairy products, producers must comply with a registered Risk Management Programme (RMP) regulated by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).

### 4.2 Compliance and Certification  
Exporters must meet requirements such as securing an export license and ensuring adherence to specific quotas and compliance programs for designated markets, including the European Union and United States. This compliance guarantees food safety and aligns products with international standards.

## 5. Trade Barriers and Costs  
### 5.1 Tariffs and Non-Tariff Measures  
The New Zealand dairy export sector faces high costs estimated at NZ$1.5 billion in tariffs and NZ$7.8 billion in non-tariff measures. These costs impede access to markets that apply significant trade tariffs, which affect almost 87% of global dairy consumption.

### 5.2 Impact of Trade Agreements  
Strategic trade agreements, like the recent deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council, aim to reduce tariffs and can help foster growth in this sector by enhancing the competitiveness of New Zealand dairy products worldwide.

## 6. Recent Developments and Future Outlook  
### 6.1 Market Trends  
Dairy exports are projected to maintain an upward trajectory due to increasing global demand, particularly in markets like China where Fonterra, New Zealand's largest dairy exporter, is expanding its footprint.

### 6.2 Strategic Initiatives  
In April 2025, the Dairy Industry Restructuring (Export Licences Allocation) Amendment Bill was passed to modernize quota systems, focusing on performance-based allocations that benefit more exporters.

### 6.3 Challenges Ahead  
Despite positive trends, the dairy sector must navigate ongoing challenges related to international trade disputes and fluctuating milk prices, particularly in light of the rising costs and tariffs affecting global dairy commodities.

## 7. Conclusion
New Zealand's dairy export sector remains a crucial economic driver, characterized by its significant contributions to export revenues and employment. As global demand continues to rise, proactive measures in trade agreements and regulatory frameworks will be essential to sustaining this sector's growth.
