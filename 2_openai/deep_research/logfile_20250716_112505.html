# Opportunities for New Zealand Kiwifruit Exports

## Introduction
New Zealand is renowned for its high-quality kiwifruit, with exports becoming a significant part of its agricultural economy. The country's leading exporter, Zespri, manages a vast proportion of kiwifruit sales worldwide, distributing several varieties that enjoy solid demand in various global markets.

This report explores the current state of New Zealand's kiwifruit exports, analyzing challenges from the 2023 season while emphasizing opportunities for recovery and growth. Key factors such as crop quality, market trends, and trade agreements are assessed to map out future prospects for exporters.

## 1. Current State of Kiwi Exports

### 1.1. Recent Trends in Export Volumes
In 2023, the adverse impact of extreme weather conditions on New Zealand's kiwifruit yields resulted in an export volume decline. According to Zespri, the estimated exports for the season are approximately **136 million trays**, down from **171 million trays** in 2022. Adverse weather events, including hailstorms and flooding, and a warm winter that hindered proper vine growth, have compounded these challenges. The industry has responded by prioritizing improved fruit quality, receiving positive reviews from primary markets in Asia and Europe despite these volume declines.

### 1.2. Export Market Breakdown
Sales of kiwifruit from New Zealand are strong in several key markets:
- **China** has emerged as the foremost destination for gold kiwifruit, accounting for an estimated NZD **$770 million** in exports.
- The **European Union**, previously the largest importer, continues to show robust demand, registering around NZD **$490 million** in kiwifruit imports.
- Other markets, including **Japan**, **Korea**, and the **United States**, also play pivotal roles, contributing to the overall success of New Zealand's kiwifruit exports.

### 1.3. Challenges Facing the Industry
The past season has highlighted several vulnerabilities within the kiwifruit export sector:
- **Weather-related stresses** such as floods, hail, and other extreme conditions have reduced crop yields and impacted product quality.
- **Global Shipping Disruptions**: Persistent issues in global logistics continue to affect timely deliveries of New Zealand kiwifruit, which is essential given the seasonal nature of production.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring high-quality standards is critical as global consumers become increasingly discerning.

## 2. Focusing on Quality and Sustainability

### 2.1. Enhancements in Fruit Quality
Despite reduced volumes, Zespri has maintained its focus on enhancing fruit quality through innovative farming practices and rigorous quality checks. Initiatives such as the **Quality Action Plan** aim to bolster assurance measures, helping to sustain and enhance brand reputation in competitive markets.

### 2.2. Environmental Sustainability Initiatives
New Zealand's kiwifruit industry is also advancing towards sustainable practices to mitigate the impact of adverse climatic conditions. Investments in **water-efficient systems**, protective structures, and the cultivation of climate-resilient kiwifruit varieties are steps taken to ensure future resilience.

## 3. International Trade Agreements

### 3.1. Impact of the New Zealand-EU FTA
One significant driver for future export growth is the ratified **New Zealand-European Union Free Trade Agreement** (FTA), which eliminates an 8.8% tariff on kiwifruit exports to the EU effective May 1, 2024. This change could save exporters approximately NZD **$52 million annually**, thereby enhancing price competitiveness in the European market, reconstructing demand dynamics in New Zealand's favor.

### 3.2. CPTPP and Tariff Reductions
In addition to the EU agreement, New Zealand has benefited from the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**. This FTA has resulted in the elimination of tariffs for exports to Japan, New Zealandâ€™s third-largest market. Forecasted savings exceeding NZD **$26 million** in tariffs reflect new revenue opportunities for exporters, with similar partnerships being explored for other markets.

### 3.3. Future Prospects with India
Negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with **India**, which currently imposes a hefty 30% tariffs on kiwifruit, presents a considerable untapped market. A successful agreement has the potential to significantly amplify trade volumes, with estimates suggesting a potential tenfold increase over the next decade.

## 4. Growth Projections and Market Trends

### 4.1. Projections for the 2024 Season and Beyond
Looking forward, optimistic projections indicate a gradual increase in kiwifruit supply. For the **2024 season**, Zespri anticipates shipping around **193 million trays**, driven by improved growing conditions and expanding orchards. Longer-term forecasts suggest supply could soar to nearly **230 million trays** by the 2027/2028 season, signaling a bright future.

### 4.2. Evolving Consumer Preferences
Consumer trends are notably shifting towards **gold kiwifruit varieties**, such as SunGold, which continue to gain popularity over traditional green varieties. Expanding licensing across northern hemisphere markets ensures that year-round supply meets consumer demand while sustaining a robust shelf presence in supermarkets.

## Conclusion
Despite the challenges that confronted New Zealand's kiwifruit industry in 2023, there remains a mosaic of opportunities on the horizon. With strategic enhancements in quality, expansion of trade agreements, and a focus on sustainable practices, New Zealand's kiwifruit sector is poised for recovery and growth. By leveraging its strengths and navigating its challenges, the industry can foster new avenues for profitable exports into emerging markets while solidifying its position in established ones.
