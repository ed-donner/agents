It enables users to build, deploy, and manage AI agents from both OpenAI and third-party developers in a unified environment. Frontier addresses \"agent sprawl\" by providing a centralized system that supports various operating environments—local, cloud, and OpenAI-hosted—and utilizes open standards for integration. Each AI agent is assigned a unique identity with specific permissions and guardrails, ensuring compliance in regulated industries.

It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed through various methods. By formulating agent execution as a Markov decision process, Agent Lightning introduces a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which includes a credit assignment module for decomposing trajectories into training transitions. Experiments across tasks like text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

It automates tasks such as online shopping, information retrieval, and form-filling, aiming to enhance user productivity by delegating routine web-based tasks to an AI agent. Operating as an experimental Chrome extension, Project Mariner understands the contents of the user's screen, interprets complex goals, plans actionable steps, and navigates websites to carry out tasks, while keeping the user informed and allowing them to intervene at any time. As of May 2025, Project Mariner is available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US and is being integrated into the Gemini API and Vertex AI, allowing developers to build applications powered by the agent.
