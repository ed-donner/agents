Introduction\\n\\nThe field of artificial intelligence agents witnessed immense innovation in 2025 as global demand surged for robust, autonomous, and collaborative digital assistants. Frameworks introduced this year pushed the boundaries in reinforcement learning, explainability, scalability, real-world autonomy, multi-agent collaboration, and developer accessibility.

              "2025 marked a leap toward comprehensive, interoperable, and accessible agent frameworks supporting a new generation of digital autonomy. While no one-size-fits-all solution has emerged, the increased specialization of frameworks—across research, enterprise, security, and productivity domains—signals the emergence of a mature, application-driven ecosystem. Developers, organizations, and researchers must weigh these nuanced differences to maximize agent potential in their fields.\n",
